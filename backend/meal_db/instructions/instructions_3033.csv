1,"In a medium-sized bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1 cup of warm water, ensuring the temperature doesn't exceed 100 degrees F.
2,"Allow it to rest for about 5 minutes or until it develops a creamy foam."
3,"In a separate bowl, combine flour, sugar, and baking soda. Now, gradually incorporate half of this flour blend into yeast mixture until it's thoroughly moist."
4,"Stir in the rest of the flour in 1/2 cup batches, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Once the dough comes together, put it onto a surface lightly dusted with flour and knead it until it's smooth and elastic, typically taking around 15 minutes."
5,"Grease a sizable bowl lightly, then insert the dough in it and roll it around to get coated in oil. Drape a thin cloth over it and let it rise in a warm area (80 to 95 degrees F) until its volume doubles, which should take approximately 1 hour."
6,"Segment the dough into 6 identical portions and shape them into round forms."
7,"Place a steam basket into a pot and fill it with water until it almost touches the bottom of the basket."
8,"Put the lid on and bring the water to a boil over high heat."
9,"Add the buns and replace the lid, letting them steam for 20 minutes. Serve while still hot."
