1,"Preheat your oven to 475Â°F if using a conventional oven, or according to your pizza oven's instructions."
2,"If using store-bought dough, let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. If making your own dough, follow the recipe's instructions for proofing and preheating."
3,"On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch the pizza dough into a 12-inch round. You can use your hands or a rolling pin."
4,"Transfer the stretched dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal."
5,"Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge."
6,"Sprinkle about half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the pizza sauce."
7,"Distribute the sliced red, yellow, and green bell peppers evenly over the first layer of cheese."
8,"Scatter the sliced red onion over the peppers."
9,"Arrange the sliced mushrooms over the pizza."
10,"Optional: Add sliced black olives and quartered artichoke hearts to the pizza."
11,"Optional: Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the vegetables."
12,"Drizzle the pizza with a tablespoon of olive oil."
13,"Optional: Sprinkle a pinch of dried oregano for a touch of herbal flavor."
14,"Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly."
15,"Keep an eye on your pizza as it bakes, as ovens can vary. The vegetables may take a few minutes longer to cook than the cheese."
16,"Once the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack for a few minutes before slicing."
17,"Garnish the pizza with chopped fresh basil leaves before serving."
