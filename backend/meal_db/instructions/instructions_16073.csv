1,Prepare by preheating the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) and greasing an 8-inch cake pan.
2,"Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture, add 2 walnut-size pieces of shortening and a splash of buttermilk to the well. Work the shortening into the flour by rubbing it in with your fingers until fully mixed."
3,"Incorporate buttermilk into flour gradually, about 1/4 cup at a time, while working it in with fingers until a sticky dough forms."
4,"Roll the dough into 8 large balls and place them in the greased cake pan, arranging them around the edges and filling the center. Flatten the dough balls with fingers until they touch and are about 3/4 to 1 inch thick."
5,"Bake at the set temperature until the tops turn golden brown, which should take around 15 to 20 minutes. Then, brush the tops with melted butter."
