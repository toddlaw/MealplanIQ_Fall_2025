Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Batter"
1,"Whisk Liquid Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the dashi stock and eggs until well combined."
2,"Sift in Dry Ingredients: Sift in the all-purpose flour and baking powder into the wet ingredients. Whisk gently until just combined. A few small lumps are okay; avoid overmixing."
B,"Prepare the Takoyaki Pan"
3,"Heat the Pan: Heat a takoyaki pan or a cast-iron skillet with round indentations over medium heat. Brush each well lightly with vegetable oil to prevent sticking."
C,"Assemble and Cook the Takoyaki"
4,"Fill the Wells: Once hot, carefully fill each well in the pan with batter, about ¾ full. **Optional:** If using additional fillings, add a small amount to the bottom of each well before pouring the batter."
5,"Add Octopus and Other Fillings: Quickly add a piece of chopped octopus and a pinch of each of your chosen fillings (tempura flakes, pickled ginger, and green onions) to the center of each batter-filled well."
6,"Cook Until Halfway Set: Cook the takoyaki for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottoms are set and begin to solidify."
7,"Flip and Shape: Using a takoyaki pick or skewer, carefully flip each takoyaki ball over 90 degrees. Continue cooking and rotating the balls every few minutes for even browning."
8,"Form Round Shapes: As you rotate the balls, use the pick to gently nudge them into round shapes, allowing the batter to flow around the fillings."
9,"Cook Until Golden Brown: Continue cooking for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the takoyaki are golden brown and crispy on the outside and cooked through on the inside."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
10,"Transfer and Top: Transfer the cooked takoyaki to a plate. Drizzle with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise. Sprinkle generously with dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and aonori (dried seaweed flakes) to taste."
11,"Serve Hot: Serve the takoyaki hot and enjoy!"
E,"Tips"
1,"If you don't have a takoyaki pan, you can use a cast-iron skillet with round indentations or a cupcake pan lined with parchment paper circles."
2,"Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and ensure even cooking."
3,"Adjust the amount of fillings to your preference."
4,"Leftover takoyaki can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Reheat them gently in a preheated oven at 350°F for a few minutes, but they may lose some of their crispness."
