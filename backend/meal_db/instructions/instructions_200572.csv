Step,Instruction
A,"For the Wontons"
1,"In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, chopped shrimp, chopped green onions, minced ginger, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (or sherry), sesame oil, and cornstarch. Mix well to combine and ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed."
2,"Lay a wonton wrapper flat on a clean work surface. Place a small spoonful of the filling in the center of the wrapper."
3,"Moisten the edges of the wonton wrapper with a little water. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling, forming a triangle. Pinch the edges together to seal the wonton, making sure there are no air pockets."
4,"Repeat steps 2-3 with the remaining wonton wrappers and filling."
B,"For the Broth"
5,"In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, minced garlic, sliced ginger, chopped green onion whites, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil over high heat."
6,"Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld."
7,"Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the solids (optional)."
8,"Season the broth with salt and black pepper to taste."
C,"Cooking the Soup"
9,"Bring the broth back to a simmer over medium heat."
10,"Carefully drop the wontons into the simmering broth, one at a time. Do not overcrowd the pot. Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the wontons float to the surface and the filling is cooked through."
D,"Serving"
11,"Ladle the soup into serving bowls and garnish with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro (optional), a drizzle of sriracha sauce (optional), and a few drops of sesame oil (optional)."
E,"Notes"
1,"This recipe yields approximately 4-6 servings."
2,"You can substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground pork.
3,"If the wonton wrappers dry out while you're assembling them, cover them with a damp cloth."
4,"Leftover wonton soup can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through."
