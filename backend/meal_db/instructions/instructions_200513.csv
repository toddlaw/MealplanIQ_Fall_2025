1,"Prepare the ingredients: Chop the kimchi, onion, green onion, and carrot (if using). Dice the bacon (or prepare your chosen protein substitute)."
2,"Heat the pan: In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the diced bacon (or protein substitute) and cook until browned and crispy. Remove the cooked protein from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil."
3,"Sauté the aromatics: Add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the pan. Add the chopped onion and scallion (white parts only). Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until softened and fragrant."
4,"Add the kimchi: Add the chopped kimchi to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly darker in color."
5,"Cook the rice: Add the cooked white rice to the pan with the kimchi mixture. Break up any clumps of rice with a spatula. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes to heat through."
6,"Seasoning: Add the soy sauce and gochujang (if using) to the pan. Stir-fry for another minute, allowing the flavors to meld."
7,"Incorporate the protein (optional): Add the cooked and drained bacon (or protein substitute) back to the pan and toss to combine."
8,"Optional additions: If using, stir in the scrambled eggs and kimchi juice (optional) to the pan and heat through for another minute."
9,"Finish and serve: Stir in the remaining chopped scallion greens (optional) and sesame oil. Taste and adjust seasonings with additional soy sauce or gochujang if desired."
10,"Serve hot: Transfer the kimchi fried rice to bowls and garnish with white sesame seeds (optional). Enjoy!"
