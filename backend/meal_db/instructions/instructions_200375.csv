1,"Trim excess fat from the lamb and cut it into thin slices. Pat the slices dry with paper towels."
2,"In a mixing bowl, combine plain yogurt, lemon juice, minced garlic cloves, dried oregano, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to form the marinade."
3,"Add the lamb slices to the marinade, making sure they are well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results."
4,"Preheat the grill to medium-high heat, around 375Â°F."
5,"Thread the marinated lamb slices onto skewers, leaving a little space between each piece."
6,"Grill the lamb skewers for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and slightly charred."
7,"While the lamb is grilling, warm the pita bread on the grill for about 1 minute on each side."
8,"Once the lamb is cooked, remove it from the skewers and place it onto a serving platter."
9,"To assemble the gyros, spread a dollop of tzatziki sauce onto each warmed pita bread. Top with sliced cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, lettuce, and grilled lamb slices."
10,"Wrap the pita bread around the filling, securing it with parchment paper or foil if needed. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious lamb gyros!"
