Step,Instruction
1,"Place the beef cubes in a large pot or Dutch oven. Cover them with cold water and soak for 30 minutes to remove some blood and impurities. Drain the water and rinse the beef thoroughly."
2,"In the same pot, combine the rinsed beef, water, scallions, onion wedges, garlic cloves, Korean radish (if using), ginger slices, and dried kelp (if using). Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat."
3,"Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface during simmering."
4,"While the beef simmers, prepare the remaining ingredients. Peel and cut the Korean pear (if using) into wedges. Hard-boil the eggs (if using) and peel them. Wash and trim the shishito peppers (if using)."
5,"After 1-1.5 hours of simmering, add the soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (or rice wine vinegar) to the pot. Stir gently to combine the seasonings."
6,"Optional Step: If using a Korean pear, add it to the pot along with the seasonings."
7,"Bring the mixture back to a simmer and cook for another 30-45 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly and reduces by about a third. The beef should be well-coated in the flavorful braising liquid."
8,"Optional Step: During the last 10 minutes of cooking, you can add the hard-boiled eggs and shishito peppers to the pot. This will allow them to heat through and absorb some of the braising flavors."
9,"Turn off the heat and let the Jangjorim cool slightly in the braising liquid. This allows the flavors to further develop and penetrate the beef."
10,"Transfer the Jangjorim to a serving dish or container. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids like ginger or garlic. You can discard the solids or reserve some of the strained braising liquid for another use."
11,"Pour the strained braising liquid over the beef and other ingredients in the serving dish. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and for the beef to absorb the sauce further. Chilled Jangjorim has a firmer texture and more intense flavor."
12,"Before serving, sprinkle with sesame seeds. Garnish with additional scallions, sliced Korean pear (if using), and shishito peppers (if using)."
13,"Serve Jangjorim cold as a side dish or appetizer with Korean meals. It also pairs well with rice bowls."
