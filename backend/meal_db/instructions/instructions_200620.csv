Step,Instruction
A,"Cook the Polenta"
1,"Bring Liquids to a Boil: In a large saucepan, combine the chicken broth, water, and kosher salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat."
2,"Gradually Whisk in Cornmeal: Slowly whisk in the yellow cornmeal in a steady stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the polenta is thickened and cooked through, stirring occasionally."
3,"Stir in Butter and Cheese: Once cooked, remove the polenta pot from the heat and stir in the unsalted butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Continue stirring until the butter is melted and the cheese is incorporated."
B,"Prepare the Grill (Optional)"
4,"Preheat Grill:**  If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat (around 400°F). Lightly oil the grate for easier cleaning."
C,"Form and Grill the Polenta (Optional)"
5. "**Pour into Baking Dish (Optional):** For easier handling on the grill, you can pour the cooked polenta into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish and spread it into an even layer. Let it cool slightly and solidify for at least 30 minutes, or until firm enough to cut."
6,"Cut and Grill: Once the polenta is firm, cut it into slices or squares of desired thickness. Brush the slices lightly with olive oil and grill them for 2-3 minutes per side, or until slightly charred and heated through."
D,"Make the Tomato Sauce (Optional)"
7,"Sauté Onion and Garlic (Optional):  In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant."
8,"Simmer the Sauce: Add the crushed tomatoes and chopped fresh basil leaves to the pan. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, or until slightly thickened."
E,"Assemble and Serve"
9,"Serve with Sauce (Optional)  Spoon the warmed tomato sauce over the grilled polenta slices.  Optional:  Top with sliced fresh mozzarella cheese, halved cherry tomatoes, and chopped fresh parsley for additional flavor and garnish."
10,"Enjoy! Serve the grilled polenta with tomato sauce hot as a delicious main course or side dish."
