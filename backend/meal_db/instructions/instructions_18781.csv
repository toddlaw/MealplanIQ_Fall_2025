1,"Start by heating a substantial pot of marginally salted water until it begins to boil. Add elbow macaroni to the boiling water, ensure to stir it sporadically until it's thoroughly cooked yet maintains a firm texture when bitten, usually around 8 minutes. Afterward, strain the macaroni and rinse it with cold water until it is cooled down."
2,"Transfer the macaroni to a sizable salad bowl, then combine it with the tomatoes, green bell pepper, cucumber, and green onion."
3,"In a bowl, combine sugar, vegetable oil, ketchup, vinegar, salt, paprika, and black pepper, whipping them together until the sugar is fully dissolved. Drizzle this dressing over the macaroni and vegetables, tossing them together for an even coating."
