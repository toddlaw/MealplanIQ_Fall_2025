1,"In a large pot, combine chicken thighs, chicken broth, onion, garlic cloves, cumin, chili powder, oregano, 1 teaspoon of salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through."
2,"Remove chicken from broth and let cool slightly. Shred chicken using two forks and discard any bones or fat."
3,"Strain broth and reserve 2 cups. In a separate saucepan, combine shredded chicken, green chiles, and remaining 1.5 teaspoons of salt. Heat over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally."
4,"In a large bowl, beat shortening on medium speed for 1 minute using an electric mixer."
5,"In a separate bowl, whisk together masa harina, baking powder, and a pinch of salt."
6,"Gradually add the dry ingredients to the shortening mixture, beating on low speed until just combined."
7,"Slowly add the reserved chicken broth, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but not wet. Beat on high speed for several minutes until smooth and elastic."
8,"Soak dried corn husks in a large bowl of hot water for at least 30 minutes, or until softened and pliable. Rinse each husk under running water to remove any dirt."
9,"Spread a thin layer of masa dough onto the wide end of a softened corn husk. Place about 2 tablespoons of chicken filling in the center of the dough. Fold the sides of the husk over the filling to enclose it. Fold the bottom of the husk up to create a closed package."
10,"Repeat step 9 with remaining dough and filling. Arrange tamales standing upright in a steamer basket. If necessary, steam tamales in batches."
11,"Fill a steamer pot with enough water to reach just below the steamer basket. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Steam tamales for 1-1.5 hours, or until the masa is cooked through and easily detaches from the corn husk."
12,"Let tamales cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!"
