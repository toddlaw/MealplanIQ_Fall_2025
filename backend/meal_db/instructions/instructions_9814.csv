Step,Instruction
1,"Combine flour and margarine in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until they create a paste."
2,"Whisk the cream into the flour mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until fully blended; then whisk in the chicken broth and parsley. Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring constantly until it thickens."
3,"Whisk together the egg yolks and lemon juice in a bowl."
4,"Whisk the egg yolk mixture gradually into the cream mixture, adding about 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce just begins to simmer and coats the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil."
5,"If a thicker sauce is preferred, mix cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the sauce in a small bowl; then stir the cornstarch mixture back into the sauce until it thickens, which should take about 2 minutes."
6,"Mix the chicken breast pieces into the sauce until they are warmed throughout."
7,"To create a lighter version, substitute light cream, low-sodium chicken broth, and light margarine."
