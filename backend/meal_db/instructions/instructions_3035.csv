1,"Pour milk into two bowls and cover them with aluminum foil. Set a steamer insert in a saucepan and add water until it reaches just below the steamer's base. Bring the water to a boil. Place the bowls of milk in the steamer, cover, and steam for approximately 5 minutes, allowing a layer of skin to develop on the surface of the milk."
2,"Lift a corner of the milk skin and pour the milk into a separate bowl, keeping the milk skin in the original bowl."
3,"Whisk together the egg whites and sugar in a bowl; then add the milk and combine thoroughly. Return the milk mixture to the 2 bowls beneath the reserved milk skin and cover them with aluminum foil."
4,"Steam the milk mixture until it is firm, around 15 minutes."
