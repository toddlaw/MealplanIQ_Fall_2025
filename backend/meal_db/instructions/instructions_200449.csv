1,"Remove the Côte de Boeuf from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before cooking to bring it to room temperature. This will ensure even cooking."
2,"Preheat your oven to 400°F."
3,"Pat the Côte de Boeuf dry with paper towels. Season generously all over with kosher salt and black peppercorns."
4,"In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully sear the Côte de Boeuf on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side, until browned and caramelized."
5,"Add the garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and rosemary sprig (if using) to the pan around the meat. Baste the Côte de Boeuf with the pan drippings occasionally."
6,"Transfer the pan with the Côte de Boeuf to the preheated oven."
7,"The recommended cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your Côte de Boeuf and your desired level of doneness. Here's a general guideline:
7a,"For rare: Cook for 15-20 minutes per inch of thickness."
7b,"For medium-rare: Cook for 20-25 minutes per inch of thickness."
7c,"For medium: Cook for 25-30 minutes per inch of thickness."
8,"Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the thickest part of the meat. For rare, aim for an internal temperature of 120°F (49°C). For medium-rare, aim for 130°F (54°C). 
9,"Once the desired internal temperature is reached, remove the pan from the oven and transfer the Côte de Boeuf to a cutting board. Tent loosely with foil and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving."
10,"While the meat rests, you can optionally make a pan sauce by deglazing the pan with a splash of red wine or beef broth, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce the liquid slightly and swirl in a knob of butter for extra richness (optional)."
11,"Carve the Côte de Boeuf into thick slices and serve with roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or your favorite sides. Enjoy with the pan sauce (if made) drizzled on top."
