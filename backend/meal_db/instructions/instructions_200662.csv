Step,Instruction
1,"Pick over the dry pinto beans to remove any debris. Rinse the beans thoroughly in cold water."
2,"In a large pot, combine the rinsed pinto beans and water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the beans are tender but still retain a slight chew. You may need to add more water during simmering if the water level gets too low."
3,"Optional Step: If using canned beans, drain and rinse them before proceeding to step 4."
4,"While the beans simmer, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
5,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic."
6,"Using Dried Beans: Once the beans are cooked, drain them, reserving about Â½ cup of the cooking liquid. Set the drained beans aside."
7,"Using Canned Beans: If using canned beans, mash them slightly with a potato masher in a bowl. Set the mashed beans aside."
8,"Mashing the Beans: Add the cooked or canned beans (depending on your choice) to the skillet with the onions and garlic. Using a potato masher or a bean masher, mash the beans to your desired consistency. You can leave them chunky or mash them until smooth. If the mixture seems dry, add some of the reserved bean cooking liquid (for dried beans) or a splash of water (for canned beans) a tablespoon at a time, until you reach a desired creamy texture."
9,"Optional Step: If using avocado oil or lard, heat it in a separate pan over medium heat until hot. Then, add it to the mashed bean mixture in the skillet for an extra layer of flavor."
10,"Season the mashed beans with salt to taste. You can also add a squeeze of lime juice (optional) for a touch of acidity."
11,"Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro (optional) before serving."
12,"Serve Refried Beans warm as a side dish with tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or other Mexican meals. You can also spread them on tortillas for a quick and delicious snack."
