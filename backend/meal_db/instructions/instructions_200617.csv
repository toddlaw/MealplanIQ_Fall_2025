Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Eggplant"
1,"Wash and cut the eggplant into ¾-inch cubes.  Optional:  Leave the skin on for added texture, but peel it if preferred."
2,"In a large bowl, toss the eggplant cubes with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt. Let them sit for 30 minutes to sweat out excess moisture."
3,"Rinse and Pat Dry: After 30 minutes, rinse the eggplant cubes thoroughly under cold water to remove the salt. Drain them well and pat them dry with paper towels to remove any remaining moisture."
B,"Sauté the Vegetables"
4,"Heat ⅓ cup of olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced red onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
5,"Stir in the chopped celery and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until softened slightly."
6,"Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic."
7,"Incorporate the Bell Pepper: Add the chopped red bell pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened."
C,"Cook the Eggplant and Add Tomato Paste"
8,"Squeeze Out Excess Moisture: Once the eggplant is prepped, squeeze out any remaining excess moisture from the cubes with your hands."
9,"Add the squeezed eggplant cubes to the pan with the softened vegetables. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is golden brown and tender-crisp."
10,"Stir in the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute, allowing it to caramelize slightly."
D,"Incorporate Remaining Ingredients and Simmer"
11,"Add the chopped green olives, raisins, drained capers, red wine vinegar, and sugar to the pan. Stir well to combine."
12,"Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the flavors meld and the sauce thickens slightly. Reduce heat to low if needed to prevent burning."
E,"Season and Serve"
13,"Season to Taste: Season the caponata with freshly ground black pepper to your liking. You may also want to adjust the saltiness at this point, depending on how salty the olives and capers are."
14,"Stir in Fresh Basil: Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil leaves."
15,"Serve Warm or at Room Temperature: The caponata can be served warm or at room temperature. It's a delicious accompaniment to grilled meats, fish, or as part of an antipasto platter."
F,"Optional Step (Chilling)"
16,"For a Colder Caponata: You can also transfer the caponata to an airtight container and refrigerate it for at least a few hours, or up to overnight, to allow the flavors to develop further. Serve chilled."
