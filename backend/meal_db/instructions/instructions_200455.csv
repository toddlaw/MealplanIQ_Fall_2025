1,"Prepare Bechamel Sauce (Optional): If making your own bechamel sauce, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in milk, a little at a time, until a smooth sauce forms. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until thickened. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. Set aside."
2,"Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
3,"Spread a thin layer of softened butter on one side of each bread slice."
4,"Assemble the sandwiches: Place 2 slices of bread, buttered side down, on a work surface. Spread a layer of bechamel sauce (適量 = to taste) on the unbuttered side of each bread slice. Top each with half of the shredded Gruyère cheese and half of the sliced ham."
5,"Spread Dijon mustard on the unbuttered side of the remaining 2 bread slices. Place them on top of the ham and cheese, mustard side down, to create sandwiches."
6,"Top each sandwich with the remaining shredded Gruyère cheese (and Parmesan cheese, if using)."
7,"Heat a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a little vegetable oil (just enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and swirl to coat."
8,"Carefully place the sandwiches in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
9,"While the sandwiches cook, fry the eggs. Heat a separate pan with a little vegetable oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan and cook to your desired doneness (sunny side up, over easy, etc.)."
10,"Transfer the browned sandwiches to the prepared baking sheet."
11,"Bake for 5-6 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly."
12,"Carefully place a fried egg on top of each sandwich."
13,"Garnish with chopped fresh chives and flaky sea salt (optional). Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste (optional)."
14,"Serve immediately while hot and enjoy!"
