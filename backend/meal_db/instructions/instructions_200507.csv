1,"Prepare the crab salad: In a large bowl, combine the lump crab meat, lemon juice, mayonnaise, diced celery, minced chives, Old Bay seasoning, kosher salt, and black pepper. Fold gently to combine all ingredients, taking care not to break up the crab meat too much."
2,"Toast the buns (optional): Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread the softened butter on the cut sides of the hot dog buns. Toast the buns in the skillet until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 1-2 minutes per side."
3,"Assemble the rolls: Fill each toasted bun (or untoasted bun if preferred) with the crab salad mixture. Divide the filling evenly between the buns."
4,"Garnish (optional): Garnish the crab rolls with fresh parsley and dill for a pop of color and flavor (optional)."
5,"Serve: Enjoy your delicious crab rolls immediately!"
