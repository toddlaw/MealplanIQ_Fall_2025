1,"For the custard: In a small saucepan, mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 5 tablespoons flour, and a pinch of salt. Gradually stir in the milk until the mixture is smooth. Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil while stirring continuously. Allow it to boil for 60 seconds, then pour a small amount of the hot liquid into the two egg yolks and stir. Return the heated egg yolks to the saucepan and mix over heat until the mixture begins to bubble again. Remove from heat and add vanilla. Cover and chill in the refrigerator."
2,"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)."
3,"For the pastry: In a medium saucepan, combine shortening and water and bring to a boil. Sift together 1 cup of flour with a pinch of salt, then pour it all at once into the boiling mixture. Stir vigorously until a ball forms. Remove from heat and add the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition. Drop spoonfuls onto a baking sheet or pipe into the desired shape."
