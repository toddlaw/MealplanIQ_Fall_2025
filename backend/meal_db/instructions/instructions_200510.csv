Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Marinate the ribs: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, honey, minced garlic, grated pear, grated kiwi, chopped scallions, sesame oil, and black pepper. Whisk well to dissolve the sugar and brown sugar."
2,"Add the short ribs to the marinade and ensure they are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or up to overnight for deeper flavor. Flip the ribs occasionally to distribute the marinade evenly."
3,"Prepare for cooking: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Alternatively, you can preheat your oven to broil with the rack positioned about 6 inches from the heat source."
4,"Grill or broil the kalbi: If grilling, remove the ribs from the marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the ribs for 3-4 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through to your desired doneness. Be careful not to burn the sugar in the marinade."
5,"If broiling, place the ribs on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Broil for 5-7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Keep an eye on the ribs under the broiler to prevent burning."
6,"Serve and garnish (optional): Once cooked, transfer the kalbi to a serving platter. Optionally, garnish with sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
7,"Enjoy your kalbi hot with rice and your favorite Korean side dishes like kimchi or pickled vegetables!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Marinating for a longer time allows the flavors to develop further."
2,"The kiwi helps tenderize the meat. If you don't have kiwi, you can substitute with another acidic fruit like pineapple or papaya, but the results may vary."
3,"You can adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of your ribs and desired level of doneness."
