1,"Toast the Dried Chiles (Optional): Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the dried chilies and toast them for a few seconds until fragrant, be careful not to burn them. Take note of the fumes, which can irritate the eyes. Remove the chilies from the skillet and set aside (optional)."
2,"Prepare the Cashews: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the cashews and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the cashews from the wok with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
3,"Marinate the Shrimp: In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the shrimp marinate for 15 minutes for extra flavor (optional)."
4,"Heat the Wok: Heat the same wok or a large skillet over high heat until hot. Add another 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (if needed) to coat the bottom of the pan."
5,"Sear the Shrimp: Add the marinated shrimp to the hot wok and spread them out in a single layer. Sear the shrimp for 1-2 minutes per side, or until pink and cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the wok and set aside on a plate."
6,"Stir-fry the Garlic and Ginger: Add the minced garlic and ginger to the hot wok and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
7,"Add Bell Pepper: Add the sliced red bell pepper to the wok and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until slightly softened."
8,"Deglaze the Wok (Optional): If desired, add a splash of chicken broth to deglaze the wok, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom (this adds extra flavor to the sauce)."
9,"Pour in Remaining Sauce Ingredients: Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, chicken broth, sugar, rice vinegar, and ground white pepper to the wok. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat."
10,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together an additional 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
11,"Return the Shrimp and Cashews: Add the cooked shrimp and toasted cashews back to the wok with the simmering sauce."
12,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the shrimp and cashews in the sauce."
13,"Garnish (Optional): Sprinkle with toasted chilies (if using) and chopped scallions for extra flavor and presentation."
14,"Serve: Turn off the heat and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Kung Pao Shrimp!"
