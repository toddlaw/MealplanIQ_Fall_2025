1,"In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the beef shank, beef chuck roast, marrow bones, onion with cloves, celery stalks, carrots, turnips, leeks, peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, thyme sprigs, and parsley sprigs."
2,"Pour enough cold water into the pot to cover the ingredients by about 2 inches."
3,"Bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as it boils, reduce heat to low, cover partially, and skim any foam that rises to the surface."
4,"Simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the beef is very tender and falling off the bone. Check the tenderness of the meat with a fork. Add more water if needed to maintain the liquid level."
5,"About 30 minutes before serving, add the potatoes to the pot and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes."
6,"Once the beef and vegetables are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat."
7,"Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the beef, vegetables, and marrow bones from the pot and transfer them to a large serving platter."
8,"Strain the broth into a bowl, discarding the solids (onion, herbs, etc.). You can skim off any excess fat from the surface of the broth if desired."
9,"Season the broth with additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed."
10,"Serve the Pot-au-feu with the hot broth ladled over the beef, vegetables, and marrow bones. You can also serve crusty bread on the side for dipping."
