Step,Instruction
A,"For the Dough"
1, "In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour."
2, "Gradually add the warm water to the flour, mixing with a fork or your hand until a shaggy dough forms. If the dough feels dry, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it becomes smooth and elastic."
3, "Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes."
B,"For the Filling"
4, "In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, shredded napa cabbage, chopped scallions, and minced ginger."
5, "Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, and cornstarch to the bowl. Mix well to combine and ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed."
C,"Assembling the Dumplings"
6, "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thin sheet, about 1/16 inch thick. Use a round cookie cutter (approximately 3-inch diameter) to cut out circles from the dough."
7, "Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle."
8, "Moisten the edges of the dough circle with a little water. Fold the dough circle in half over the filling, forming a crescent shape. Pinch the edges together to seal the dumpling, making sure there are no air pockets."
9, "Repeat steps 6-8 with the remaining dough and filling."
D,"Steaming the Dumplings"
10, "Lightly grease a bamboo steamer basket with vegetable oil to prevent sticking."
11, "Arrange the dumplings in the steamer basket, leaving a little space between them to allow for expansion during steaming."
12, "Fill a pot with enough water to reach just below the bottom of the steamer basket. Bring the water to a boil over high heat."
13, "Place the steamer basket on top of the pot and cover with a lid. Steam the dumplings for 8-10 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through."
14, "Carefully remove the steamer basket from the pot and let the dumplings cool slightly before serving."
E,"Serving"
15, "Serve the steamed dumplings hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as soy sauce with vinegar and chili oil, or a simple sesame oil and ginger sauce."
