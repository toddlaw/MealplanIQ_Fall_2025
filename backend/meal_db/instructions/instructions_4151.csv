1,"Prepare the oven by preheating it to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)."
2,"Place bread triangles on a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven until they are lightly browned and dry, approximately 5 minutes on each side."
3,"Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the bread triangles in batches until they are golden brown, about 2 to 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bread and drain on a plate lined with paper towels."
4,"Garnish the soaked bread triangles with crushed pistachios and serve warm."
5,"Simmer milk in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the soaked bread triangles to the simmering milk and cook on low heat until the milk is absorbed into the bread and the fat begins to separate, about 10 to 15 minutes. Mix in the raisins. Top with almonds and cashews."
6,"The nutritional value of oil used for frying has been calculated based on a retention rate of 10% after cooking. Actual amounts may differ based on factors such as cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil utilized."
7,"You can alternatively let the bread slices sit on a tray to dry for 12 hours instead of toasting them in the oven."
