1,"Cream together shortening and 1 cup of sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg, then mix in the cream and vanilla. Combine 3 1/2 cups of flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until firm."
2,"Stir the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and stir in the chopped nuts."
3,"Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out 48 circles using a 2 1/2 to 3-inch round cutter. To assemble the cookies, place one circle on the cookie sheet, add a teaspoon of filling in the center, then cover with another circle. Seal the edges together using a fork. Repeat with the remaining dough, placing the cookies 2 inches apart on the sheets."
4,"Prepare cookies for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges turn golden brown. Remember that the filling will be extremely hot when you take them out. Cool the cookies on wire racks."
