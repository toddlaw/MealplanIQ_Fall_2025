1,"Combine rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer until all the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes."
2,"In a separate bowl, combine fish sauce, lime juice, and garlic. Pour over the cooled rice and gently mix to incorporate."
3,"Toss avocado slices in a bowl with lemon juice."
4,"Using wet hands, roll the sushi mat tightly, pressing gently to form a sturdy roll."
5,"Lift the edge of the sushi mat, fold the bottom edge of the mat up to enclose the filling, and tightly roll the sushi into a thick cylinder. After rolling, wrap it in the mat and gently squeeze to compact it firmly. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients to create 4 rolls. Place the rolls on a serving plate, cut into 6 or 8 pieces per roll, and cover with damp paper towels until ready to serve."
