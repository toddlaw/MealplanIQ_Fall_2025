1,"In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the sugar and butter until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Alternate adding the flour mixture and buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Stir in the vanilla and any additional ingredients, such as nuts or chocolate chips."
2,"Pour the batter into the prepared pan or pans and smooth the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely."
3,"Bake the Bundt cake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, which should take about one hour. (Begin checking for doneness after 50 minutes.) Allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before inverting onto a plate and tapping it out of the pan. If you like, you can dust it with confectioners' sugar, sprinkle with cinnamon, or drizzle with warm honey before serving."
