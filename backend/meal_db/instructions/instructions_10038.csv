1,"Combine the flour, milk, egg, and salt in a medium mixing bowl, and whisk together."
2,"Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium high heat. Once hot, add a teaspoon of butter to the pan and swirl to coat the surface."
3,"Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan, then tilt the pan in a circular motion to ensure the batter spreads evenly on the surface."
4,"Check the crepe after two minutes by lifting an edge with a spatula to see if it is browning. Once the underside has started to brown, flip the crepe and cook the other side until it browns as well, which should take about 2 minutes."
