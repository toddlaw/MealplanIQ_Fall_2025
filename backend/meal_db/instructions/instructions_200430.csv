1,"Prepare the Ingredients: Cook the rice according to package instructions and let it cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (cold, dry rice is key for fried rice)."
2,"Marinate the Shrimp (Optional): If using shrimp, toss them with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and a pinch of white pepper in a bowl. Marinate for 15 minutes for extra flavor (optional)."
3,"Whisk the Eggs: In a small bowl, whisk the eggs together with a splash of water until well combined."
4,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
5,"Scramble the Eggs: Push the oil to the sides of the wok. Pour in the whisked eggs and scramble them quickly until cooked through. Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and set aside."
6,"Stir-fry the Shrimp (Optional): If using shrimp, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Stir-fry the shrimp for 1-2 minutes per side, or until pink and cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the wok and set aside on a plate."
7,"Stir-fry the Vegetables: Add the diced carrots and green onions (scallions) to the wok and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until slightly softened."
8,"Add the Peas: Add the thawed peas and stir-fry for an additional minute."
9,"Add the Cold Rice: Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok. Add the cooled, cooked rice and spread it out in a single layer. Let the rice sit for a few seconds to heat up slightly."
10,"Season and Stir-fry the Rice: Drizzle the light soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice. Using a spatula, break up any clumps of rice and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors."
11,"Add the Scrambled Eggs: Add the cooked and scrambled eggs back to the wok and stir-fry to combine with the rice and vegetables."
12,"Add the Shrimp (Optional): If using shrimp, add them back to the wok and stir-fry for another minute to heat them through."
13,"Season with Sesame Oil and Pepper: Drizzle the toasted sesame oil over the fried rice and stir-fry for another minute. Season with white pepper to taste."
14,"Serve: Garnish with additional chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious Chinese-style shrimp fried rice!**"
