1,"Wash and trim the green beans. You can cut them into bite-sized pieces diagonally for more surface area (optional)."
2,"Heat the neutral oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking."
3,"**Optional:** If using dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns, add them to the hot oil and toast for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them, as this can make the dish bitter."
4,"Add the minced garlic and ginger to the oil and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
5,"Increase the heat to high and add the green beans. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the green beans are blistered and slightly tender-crisp."
6,"Optional: If using ground Sichuan peppercorn, add it to the pan along with the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (or sherry), and sugar. Stir-fry for another minute, allowing the flavors to combine."
7,Optional (if using dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns): Remove the toasted chilies and peppercorns from the pan (if using) with a slotted spoon before adding the sauce ingredients."
8,"Pour in the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (or sherry), and sugar. Stir-fry for an additional minute, allowing the sauce to reduce and coat the green beans."
9,"Drizzle in the toasted sesame oil and toss to coat the green beans."
10,"Season with salt to taste. Be careful not to oversalt, as the soy sauce already adds saltiness."
11,"Turn off the heat and transfer the Sichuan green beans to a serving plate. Garnish with chopped scallions (optional) and serve hot over rice."
12,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 2-3 servings. Adjust the amount of dried red chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, and ground Sichuan peppercorn based on your desired level of spice. You can substitute Shaoxing wine with dry sherry or chicken broth for a similar flavor. Leftover Sichuan green beans can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or microwave until warmed through, but the green beans may lose some crispness."
