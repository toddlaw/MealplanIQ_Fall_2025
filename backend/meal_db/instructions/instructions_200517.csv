Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the gochujang, honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, minced ginger, Korean chili flakes (gochugaru), and white pepper. Whisk well to dissolve the sugars and chili flakes."
2,"Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and ensure they are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight for deeper flavor. Flip the chicken occasionally to distribute the marinade evenly."
3,"Prepare the double coating (batter): In a separate large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, potato starch (or all-purpose flour), and water until a smooth batter forms. The batter should be slightly thick but pourable."
4,"Heat the oil for frying: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat enough vegetable oil (at least 1 liter or 4 cups) over medium heat to 350°F (175°C). You can check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer or by dropping a small piece of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and floats to the surface, the oil is hot enough."
5,"First fry (optional): This step is optional but helps achieve a crispier texture. Fry the uncoated chicken pieces in batches for 5-7 minutes per side, or until lightly golden brown. Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes. This allows the chicken to cool slightly and helps the second coating adhere better."
6,"Second fry: Once the first-fried chicken has cooled slightly (or if skipping the first fry), dredge each chicken piece in the batter, ensuring it's evenly coated. Carefully lower the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil (350°F or 175°C). Do not overcrowd the pot."
7,"Fry until golden brown and crispy: Fry the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) for safe consumption."
8,"Drain and serve: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil. Let them cool slightly before serving."
9,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle with chopped scallions and sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
10,"Enjoy hot: Serve your Korean fried chicken hot with your favorite dipping sauces like kimchi mayo or gochujang sauce. Enjoy! "
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Marinating for a longer time allows the flavors to develop further."
2,"The double coating helps achieve a crispy exterior. You can adjust the ratio of cornstarch and potato starch (or use all-purpose flour) depending on your preference for crispness."
3,"The first fry is optional but recommended for extra crispy chicken."
4,"Be careful not to overcrowd the pot while frying to maintain the oil temperature and ensure even cooking."
