1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
2,"In a large bowl, blend together the butter and sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one by one, mixing until the mixture is light and fluffy. Whisk together the flour, cardamom, and cinnamon; then fold into the sugar mixture just until incorporated."
3,"Divide the dough into 6 portions and roll each portion into a rope approximately the size of your finger on a lightly floured surface. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch pieces and arrange them on an ungreased baking sheet."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until they are lightly browned. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely."
