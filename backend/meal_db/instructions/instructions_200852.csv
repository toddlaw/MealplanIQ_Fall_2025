1,"Warm the milk: In a small bowl, warm the milk in the microwave until it's lukewarm (about 110°F)."
2,"Activate the yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, and sugar. Let stand for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy."
3,"Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt."
4,"Combine wet ingredients: In the bowl with the yeast mixture, beat in the softened butter and egg until combined."
5,"Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic."
6,"First rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours."
7,"Prepare the filling: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Set aside."
8,"Roll out the dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12x15-inch rectangle."
9,"Spread the filling: Soften the butter and spread it evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the butter."
10,"Roll the dough: Starting from a long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Pinch the seam to seal."
11,"Cut the dough: Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 12 equal slices."
12,"Place in pan: Place the slices cut-side up in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan."
13,"Second rise: Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in size."
14,"Bake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown."
15,"Make the icing: In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth."
