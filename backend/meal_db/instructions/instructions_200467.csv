1,"Preheat your oven to 475Â°F if using a conventional oven, or according to your pizza oven's instructions."
2,"If using store-bought dough, let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. If making your own dough, follow the recipe's instructions for proofing and preheating."
3,"On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch the pizza dough into a 12-inch round. You can use your hands or a rolling pin."
4,"Transfer the stretched dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal."
5,"Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge."
6,"Sprinkle about half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the pizza sauce."
7,"Distribute the diced ham evenly over the first layer of cheese."
8,"Top the ham with the drained pineapple chunks (or fresh pineapple chunks, patted dry to avoid excess moisture)."
9,"Optional: Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the pineapple."
10,"Drizzle the pizza with a tablespoon of olive oil."
11,"Optional: Sprinkle a pinch of dried oregano for a touch of herbal flavor."
12,"Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly."
13,"Keep an eye on your pizza as it bakes, as ovens can vary. The pineapple chunks may take slightly longer to cook through than the other toppings."
14,"Once the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack for a few minutes before slicing."
15,"Optional: Garnish the pizza with fresh parsley for a pop of color."
16,"Serve your Hawaiian Pizza hot and enjoy (even if the traditionalists might not)!"
