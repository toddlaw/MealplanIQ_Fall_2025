1,"Prepare the chicken: Thinly slice the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces."
2,"Make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the chicken stock (or dashi), soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sugar dissolves."
3,"Cook the chicken: Heat a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the sliced chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through."
4,"Pour in the sauce: Pour the prepared sauce from the saucepan into the pan with the cooked chicken."
5,"Simmer and thicken: Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly."
6,"Beat the eggs: In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs until well-beaten."
7,"Add the eggs: Slowly pour the beaten eggs over the simmering chicken and sauce in the pan. Let the eggs cook undisturbed for about 30 seconds, until they start to set at the edges."
8,"Cook to desired consistency: Using chopsticks or a spoon, gently stir the partially cooked eggs to create fluffy curds. Continue cooking for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the eggs are cooked to your desired consistency (slightly runny or fully set)."
9,"Serve: Divide the cooked white rice evenly between two bowls. Top each bowl with the oyakodon chicken and egg mixture, spooning over the flavorful sauce. Optionally garnish with chopped green onions, a drizzle of sesame oil, and a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi."
