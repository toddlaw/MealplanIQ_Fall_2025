1,Combine the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the buttermilk while stirring with a fork until a soft dough is formed.
2,"Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 to 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape it into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight."
3,Heat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius).
4,"Roll or pat out the dough to 1-inch thickness, cut out rounds using a biscuit cutter, and place them on a baking sheet. Next time, work quickly as the biscuits don't need much handling to rise effectively."
5,Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
