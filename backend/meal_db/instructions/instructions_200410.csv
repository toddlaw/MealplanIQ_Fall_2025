1,"Take the steak out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. This promotes even cooking."
2,"Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove any surface moisture. Moisture can prevent a good sear."
3,"Season the steak generously with salt and black pepper on both sides."
4,"Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the olive oil. Carefully swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan."
5,"When the oil is shimmering hot, carefully place the steak in the pan. Sear the steak undisturbed for 2-3 minutes per side for a medium-rare doneness.  For a more well-done steak, sear for an additional 1-2 minutes per side."
6,"**(Optional) Add butter, garlic cloves, and thyme sprigs to the pan while searing the steak for additional flavor.** Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter with herbs and garlic over the steak for basting (optional)."
7,"Use tongs to turn the steak. Avoid using a fork, as this can pierce the meat and release juices."
8,"Once seared, an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) is ideal for medium-rare steak. You can use a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak to check for doneness."
9,"**(Optional) For a thicker steak, you can transfer the pan to a preheated oven (400 degrees Fahrenheit / 200 degrees Celsius) after searing to bring it to desired internal temperature.** Continue cooking for 5-7 minutes per side, or until the desired temperature is reached."
10,"Transfer the steak to a plate and tent it loosely with foil. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat for a more tender and flavorful steak."
11,"Slice the steak against the grain and enjoy!"
