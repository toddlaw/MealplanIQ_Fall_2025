Step,Instruction
1,Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line three jelly roll pans with parchment paper. Get ready a pastry bag fitted with a size 6 tip (1/2 inch).
2,"Combine egg yolks with half of the sugar and vanilla; beat until very light colored, about 5 minutes."
3,Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add salt and the remaining sugar while beating. Carefully fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolks.
4,Fold in sifted flour into the egg mixture gently.
5,"Pipe half of the batter into the pastry bag and pipe rows of 3 1/2 inch fingers, spaced 1 1/2 inches apart, onto the parchment-lined pans. Repeat the process with the remaining batter."
6,"Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for around 15 minutes until the fingers are firm to the touch and golden. Transfer the fingers from the baking sheet to racks to cool. Once cooled, peel fingers from the paper and either use immediately or store between layers of wax paper in an airtight container. These also freeze nicely."
