1,"In a large bowl, whisk together masa harina, baking powder, and salt."
2,"In a separate bowl, melt vegetable shortening. Slowly add the hot shortening to the dry ingredients, mixing with a spoon until a crumbly mixture forms."
3,"Gradually add vegetable broth, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but not wet. Knead for several minutes until smooth and elastic."
4,"Soak dried corn husks in a large bowl of hot water for at least 30 minutes, or until softened and pliable. Rinse each husk under running water to remove any dirt."
5,"Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and chili powder, and cook for another minute."
6,"Stir in corn kernels, black beans, diced tomatoes, green chiles, and chopped cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until heated through."
7,"Spread a thin layer of masa dough onto the wide end of a softened corn husk. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the husk."
8,"Add 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable filling to the center of the dough. If using vegan cheese, sprinkle some on top of the filling (optional)."
9,"Fold the sides of the husk over the filling to enclose it. Fold the bottom of the husk up to create a closed package."
10,"Repeat step 5-9 with remaining dough and filling. Arrange tamales standing upright in a steamer basket. If necessary, steam tamales in batches."
11,"Fill a steamer pot with enough water to reach just below the steamer basket. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Steam tamales for 1-1.5 hours, or until the masa is cooked through and easily detaches from the corn husk."
12,"Let tamales cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!"
