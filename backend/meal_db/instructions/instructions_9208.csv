1,"Blend together milk and eggs in a blender, then add flour, sugar, and salt, blending until the mixture is smooth."
2,"Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and warm it over medium-high heat. Pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, tilting the pan to spread the batter evenly across the bottom. Cook until the top appears dry, which takes about 30 seconds. Gently slide a spatula beneath the pancake and flip it over. Cook until it turns brown on the other side, roughly 3 seconds. Move to a plate and continue with the rest of the batter."
