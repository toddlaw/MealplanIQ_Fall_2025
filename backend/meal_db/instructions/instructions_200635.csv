1,"Heat Oil in a Pan: Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat."
2,"Sauté the Shishito Peppers: Add the shishito peppers to the hot pan. Sauté them for 2-3 minutes per side, or until blistered and slightly softened, turning them occasionally with tongs."
3,"Season with Salt:  Season the cooked peppers with a sprinkle of kosher salt to taste."
4,"Serve with Yuzu Kosho: Transfer the cooked shishito peppers to a serving plate.  Serve immediately with a dollop of yuzu kosho paste on the side for dipping.  **Optional:** Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil for added flavor (optional)."
5,"Garnish (Optional):  For additional flavor and texture, garnish with toasted sesame seeds, a few bonito flakes (katsuobushi), or sliced scallions (optional)."
A,"Tips:"
1,"Shishito peppers can vary in heat level, with most being mild and some having a surprising kick. Start with a small amount of yuzu kosho and adjust to your desired spice level."
2,"Wear gloves when handling yuzu kosho paste as it can be quite spicy."
3,"Leftover shishito peppers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them gently in a pan over medium heat until warmed through, but the texture may become softer."
