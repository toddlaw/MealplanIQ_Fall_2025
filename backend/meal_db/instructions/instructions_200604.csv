Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to desired temperature (see options below)."
2,"Prepare the Bread: Cut the loaf of bread in half lengthwise, or into slices about 1 inch thick, depending on your preference."
3,"Choose either the Toasting Method (steps 4a-7a), or the Broiling Method (steps 4b-7b)"
A,"Oven-toasted Method"
4a,"Preheat your oven to 350Â°F."
5a,"Prepare the Garlic Butter:** In a small bowl, combine softened butter, minced garlic, chopped fresh parsley (if using), salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well to create a garlic butter mixture."
6a,"Spread the Garlic Butter:** Spread the garlic butter generously over the cut sides of the bread."
7a,"Bake the Garlic Bread:** Place the bread slices on a baking sheet, cut side facing up. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown and the butter is melted and bubbly."
B,"For Broiled Garlic Bread"
4b,"Preheat your broiler to high."
5b,"Combine Garlic with Olive Oil (Optional): In a small bowl, combine minced garlic and olive oil. This method creates a looser garlic topping compared to creamed garlic butter."
6b,"Brush the Bread with Garlic Oil (Optional): Brush the cut sides of the bread with the garlic oil mixture (or use the garlic butter mixture from option 3a if preferred)."
7b,"Broil the Garlic Bread: Place the bread slices on a baking sheet, cut side facing up. Broil for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and bubbly. Keep a close eye on the bread under the broiler to prevent burning."
C,"Serve"
8,"Serve Immediately: Enjoy the garlic bread hot and fresh from the oven or broiler. You can serve it as a side dish, appetizer, or use it for dipping in soups or stews."
