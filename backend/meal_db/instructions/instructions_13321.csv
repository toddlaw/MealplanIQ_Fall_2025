1,Assemble all the necessary ingredients.
2,"Combine 1 cup of flour with yeast and sugar in a bowl. Add water and softened butter, mixing until well blended. Allow the mixture to sit until bubbles start to form, approximately 15 minutes."
3,"Gradually mix salt into the yeast mixture, then add 2 1/2 cups of flour slowly until the dough forms a ball that can be picked up."
4,"Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic, for about 8 minutes, adding extra flour if necessary."
5,Divide the dough into 6 portions and allow it to rest briefly.
6,Take one portion and shape it into a 15-inch rope; then form the rope into a pretzel shape by looping and twisting it. Repeat with the remaining portions to create pretzels. Cover and allow them to rise for 15 minutes.
7,Heat your oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C) and grease a baking sheet.
8,"Heat 3 cups of water in a pot until boiling, then add baking soda and remove from heat."
9,"Submerge the pretzels in the water bath for approximately 45 seconds, ensuring each side gets soaked."
10,"Place the soaked pretzels onto the greased baking sheet, then brush them with melted butter and sprinkle with salt."
11,"Bake until the pretzels are golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes."
12,"In April 2023, our test kitchen experimented with this recipe and recommended increasing the flour by up to 2/3 cup from the original 3 cups."
