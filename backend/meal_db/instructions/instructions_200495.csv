Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the dashi mixture: In a small saucepan, combine the dashi stock, soy sauce, mirin, sake (if using), and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar and simmer for 2-3 minutes."
2,"Lightly beat the eggs: In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs until well-beaten but not frothy."
3,"Cook the tamago (egg): Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add a thin layer of the simmering dashi mixture to coat the bottom of the pan. Swirl the pan to coat evenly."
4,"Pour in the eggs: Once the dashi mixture starts to simmer gently, slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pan."
5,"Cook the eggs partially: Let the eggs cook undisturbed for about 15-20 seconds, or until the edges begin to set."
6,"Curdle the eggs: Using chopsticks or a spatula, gently push the cooked edges of the egg towards the center of the pan. Tilt the pan slightly to allow the runny egg to flow underneath the cooked portion. Repeat this process, gently curdling the eggs, until most of the liquid egg is cooked."
7,"Optional doneness: If you prefer a slightly runny egg yolk, remove the pan from heat at this point. For a more fully cooked egg, continue to cook for another 10-15 seconds, or until desired consistency is reached."
8,"Assemble and serve: Divide the cooked white rice between two bowls. Top each bowl with the cooked tamago (egg). Spoon over some of the remaining dashi sauce from the pan. Optionally garnish with thinly sliced green onions and enjoy immediately."
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Dashi stock adds a savory umami flavor, but you can substitute it with water and dashi powder."
2,"Sake adds a subtle depth of flavor, but it's optional." 
3,"You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and sugar to your taste preference for a saltier or sweeter tamago donburi."
