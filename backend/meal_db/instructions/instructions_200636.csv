Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Batter"
1,"Whisk Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt."
2,"Whisk Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and dashi stock (or water) until well combined."
3,"Combine Wet and Dry: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. A few small lumps are okay; do not overmix."
4,"Fold in Tenkasu: Gently fold in the tenkasu (tempura flakes) to the batter."
B,"Prepare the Okonomiyaki Base"
5,"Heat Oil in a Pan: Heat a large griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan."
6,"Spread the Cabbage: Spread half of the shredded cabbage evenly over the heated pan, forming a round or oval shape. Press down gently to form a compact layer."
7,"Optional Meat Layer: If using cooked and shredded meat, sprinkle it evenly over the cabbage layer."
8,"Pour the Batter: Pour about Â½ of the prepared batter over the cabbage and meat layer (or just cabbage layer if not using meat), spreading it evenly to cover the ingredients."
C,"Cooking the Okonomiyaki"
9,"Cook Until Set: Let the okonomiyaki cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, or until the bottom is golden brown and the batter starts to set."
10,"Flip and Cook the Other Side:  Carefully use a large spatula to flip the okonomiyaki. You may need to cut it into quarters or halves with the spatula to make flipping easier. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown and the inside is cooked through."
D,"Assemble and Serve"
11,"Transfer to Plate: Transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to a plate."
12,"Top Generously: Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise to taste. Sprinkle generously with dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and aonori (dried seaweed flakes)."
13,"Additional Toppings (Optional): Add any of your chosen additional toppings like shredded carrots, bean sprouts, green onions, fried or steamed eggs, or pickled ginger (beni shoga)."
14,"Optional Dancing Katsuobushi: For an impressive presentation, you can use "dancing katsuobushi" (thinly shaved bonito flakes that move and flutter in the heat). Place a small pile on top of your okonomiyaki, and the warmth will cause them to 'dance'."
15,"Serve and Enjoy: Serve your okonomiyaki hot and enjoy!" 
E,"Tips:"
1,"A griddle or a large non-stick pan works best for cooking okonomiyaki."
2,"If the batter seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of water to thin it slightly."
3,"Be careful not to overcook the okonomiyaki, as it can become dry."
4,"You can get creative with your toppings! Leftover okonomiyaki can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. However, the texture may not be as crispy when reheated."
