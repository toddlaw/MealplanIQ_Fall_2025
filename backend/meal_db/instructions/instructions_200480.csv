1,"Prepare the chicken: Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness of about ½ inch. You can place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound them gently."
2,"Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper to taste."
3,"Dredge the chicken breasts in the all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess."
4,"Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan. Once the butter has melted and is starting to foam, carefully add the floured chicken breasts."
5,"Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. You can cut into the thickest part of the chicken to check if it's white and cooked through with no pink remaining."
6,"Optional: If the chicken breasts are thick, you can transfer them to a plate and keep them warm in a preheated oven at 200°F (93°C) while you prepare the sauce."
7,"Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan. Once melted, swirl the pan to coat the bottom."
8,"Add the lemon juice to the pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Let the lemon juice simmer for a minute or two, allowing the flavors to develop."
9,"Pour in the chicken broth and white wine (if using). Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, or until slightly reduced."
10,"Stir in the capers and cook for another minute."
11,"Optional: If the sauce seems too thin, you can simmer it for a few additional minutes to allow it to thicken slightly. Alternatively, you can whisk in a cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) to thicken the sauce."
12,"Return the cooked chicken breasts to the pan and spoon the lemon caper sauce over them. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for an additional minute or two to heat through."
13,"Serve the Chicken Piccata immediately, garnished with fresh chopped parsley (optional)."
14,"Enjoy this classic and flavorful Italian dish!"
