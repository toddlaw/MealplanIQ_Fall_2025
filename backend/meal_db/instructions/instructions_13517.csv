1,"Gently pound the chicken breasts between sheets of wax paper to about 1/8 inch thickness, being careful not to tear the chicken. Wrap and refrigerate the chicken until the compound butter is firm."
2,"Combine softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper and garlic powder in a small bowl, mix thoroughly. Spread the seasoned butter into a 2x4 inch rectangle on a piece of aluminum foil, then freeze until firm."
3,"Roll and enclose each seasoned butter piece in chicken breast, folding and securing edges with toothpicks."
