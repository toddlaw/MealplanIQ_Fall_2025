step,instruction
1,"Prepare the Vegetables: Thinly slice or chop all the vegetables. The cabbage, carrots, celery, and bell pepper should be julienned (cut into thin matchsticks) for a more traditional chow mein appearance."
2,"Cook the Noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the chow mein noodles according to package instructions, usually for 3-5 minutes for dried noodles or following the recommended time for fresh noodles. Drain the noodles thoroughly and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Stir-fry the Cabbage and Carrots: Add the sliced cabbage and julienned carrots to the hot wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the cabbage starts to soften slightly."
5,"Add Celery and Bell Pepper: Add the sliced celery and bell pepper to the wok and stir-fry for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until slightly softened."
6,"Add Broccoli: Add the broccoli florets to the wok and stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes, or until crisp-tender."
7,"Remove the Vegetables: Transfer the stir-fried vegetables to a plate and set aside."
8,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), brown sugar, rice vinegar, cornstarch, and water. Set aside."
9,"Stir-fry the Garlic and Ginger: Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
10,"Pour in the Sauce: Add the prepared sauce mixture to the wok and bring to a simmer over medium heat."
11,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together an additional 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
12,"Return the Vegetables and Noodles: Add the cooked vegetables and drained noodles back to the wok with the simmering sauce."
13,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the noodles in the sauce."
14,"Serve: Heat through for another minute or two. Turn off the heat and transfer the vegetable chow mein to a serving platter."
15,"Garnish (Optional): Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions for extra flavor and presentation. Enjoy your delicious vegetable chow mein!"
