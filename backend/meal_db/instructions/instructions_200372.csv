2,"Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Place the hollowed-out peppers in a baking dish, standing upright."
3,"Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. In a skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat."

11,"Once done, remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving."
12,"Serve the chicken stuffed peppers hot as a delicious and satisfying meal. Enjoy!"
