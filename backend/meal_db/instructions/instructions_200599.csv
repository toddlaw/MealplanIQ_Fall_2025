Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the Vegetables: Wash and chop the vegetables into similar-sized pieces suitable for grilling. For example, cut bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant into wedges or slices, and asparagus can be left whole or cut into thirds."
2,"Optional Step (For Softer Vegetables): If using vegetables that tend to be softer like eggplant, you can salt them lightly and let them sit for 15-20 minutes. This step helps draw out excess moisture, resulting in less mushy grilled vegetables. Rinse the eggplant slices thoroughly under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels before grilling."
3,"Prepare the Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, Herbs de Provence, salt, and freshly ground black pepper."
4,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): If using, add minced garlic and chopped red onion wedges to the marinade."
5,"Marinate the Vegetables: Add the chopped vegetables to the marinade and toss to coat them evenly. Let the vegetables marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for stronger flavor."
6,"Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400°F to 450°F).** You can use a charcoal grill, gas grill, or a grill pan on your stovetop."
7,"Optional Step (For Smoky Flavor): If using a charcoal grill, let the coals heat up and then push them to one side to create a two-zone cooking area. This allows you to sear the vegetables over direct heat and then move them to the indirect heat side to finish cooking without burning."
8,"Thread the vegetables onto skewers (optional): You can thread the marinated vegetables onto skewers for easier grilling and flipping. Alternatively, you can grill them directly on the grates."
9,"Grill the Vegetables: Place the vegetables on the preheated grill. If using skewers, make sure they are spaced evenly. Grill the vegetables for 3-5 minutes per side, or until tender-crisp and slightly charred. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness and type of vegetables used."
10,"Optional Step (For Extra Herbs): During the last minute of grilling, you can sprinkle some chopped fresh herbs (parsley, thyme, rosemary) over the vegetables for additional flavor."
11,"Serve the Grilled Vegetables with Herbs de Provence hot as a delicious side dish or vegetarian main course. Enjoy!"
