1,"Place saffron in a small bowl and pour in 1/2 cup of boiling water; let steep."
2,"Add 1 1/2 cups boiling water and the saffron mixture to the skillet with the rice; cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until water is fully absorbed and rice is tender."
3,"Quickly add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of boiling water along with the saffron water. Cover right away, lower the heat to low, and cook until all the liquid is absorbed, which takes about 20 minutes. For optimal results, avoid lifting the lid while the rice cooks."
