Step,Instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the glass noodles (japchae) and cook according to package instructions, typically for 4-5 minutes. Drain the noodles thoroughly in a colander and rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking process. Toss with a little sesame oil to prevent sticking."
2,"While the noodles are cooking, prepare the vegetables. Julienne the carrot and onion."
3,"Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced Korean beef (bulgogi) if using. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and cooked through."
4,"**Optional Step:** If not using bulgogi, skip step 3 and proceed to the next step."
5,"Push the cooked bulgogi (or leave empty if not using) to the side of the pan. Add the julienned carrots and onions to the empty side of the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until softened slightly but still retain some crispness."
6,"Add the minced garlic to the pan and cook for another 30 seconds, or until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic."
7,"Add the drained and rinsed glass noodles back to the pan. Toss with the vegetables and bulgogi (if using) to combine."
8,"Pour in soy sauce, sugar, and a pinch of black pepper (optional). Toss everything together to ensure even distribution of the seasonings."
9,"Finally, add the perilla leaves (kkaennip) to the pan. Gently fold them in with the other ingredients using tongs or a spatula. Be careful not to overcook the perilla leaves, as they should remain slightly wilted but still retain their vibrant green color."
10,"Cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the perilla leaves are heated through and the flavors are well combined."
11,"Turn off the heat and sprinkle with Korean sesame seeds to taste."
12,"Serve Kkaennip Japchae immediately as a warm side dish with Korean meals."
