1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the elbow macaroni and cook according to package instructions for al dente (typically 8-12 minutes)."
2,"While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to create a roux (a paste that will thicken the sauce)."
3,"Slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until fully incorporated. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."
4,"Remove the pan from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese. Let the cheese melt, stirring constantly, until smooth and creamy. If using, add the shredded Gruyere cheese and stir to combine."
5,"Drain the cooked macaroni and return it to the pot. Pour the hot cheese sauce over the macaroni and toss gently to coat evenly."
6,"Transfer the macaroni and cheese to a serving dish. Sprinkle with paprika (optional) for a touch of color."
7,"Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade macaroni and cheese!"
