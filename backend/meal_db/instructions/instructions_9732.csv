1,"Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Grease and flour a baking sheet."
2,"Whip the egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until they become foamy, using an electric mixer. Gradually add the sugar while whipping at medium speed. Once the mixture turns stiff and shiny, resembling satin, stop mixing and transfer it to a large pastry bag. Pipe the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet using a large round tip or star tip."
3,"Put the meringues in the preheated oven, and use the handle of a wooden spoon to prop the door open slightly."
4,"Bake until the meringues are dry and can be removed from the pan without difficulty, which should take about 3 hours. Let the cookies cool completely before placing them in an airtight container at room temperature."
