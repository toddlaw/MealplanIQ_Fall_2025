Step,Instruction
A,"Marinate the Chicken"
1,"Prepare the Marinade: In a large bowl, whisk together the mirin, sake, soy sauce, sugar, and honey to create the yakitori tare marinade."
2,"Marinate the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces and green onion pieces to the marinade. Toss to coat the chicken evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for deeper flavor."
B,"Prepare and Grill"
3,"Prepare the Skewers: Thread the marinated chicken pieces and green onion pieces onto the soaked yakitori skewers, alternating them for even cooking."
4,"Preheat Grill: Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. You can also use an indoor broiler."
5,"Grill the Yakitori: Grill the chicken skewers for 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through and browned on all sides. Brush the yakitori occasionally with the remaining marinade during grilling for added flavor."
C,"Optional Glaze (Final Minute)"
6,"**Optional Glaze (Final Minute): In a small saucepan, combine the optional glaze ingredients (soy sauce and honey). Heat it over low heat until slightly simmering. In the last minute of grilling, brush the yakitori with the glaze for a sticky finish (optional)."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
7,"Transfer and Rest: Transfer the cooked yakitori skewers to a plate and let them rest for a few minutes before serving."
8,"Serve Hot: Serve the yakitori hot with your desired accompaniments like shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice powder) for a touch of heat, lemon wedges for squeezing, and aonori (dried seaweed flakes) for garnish (optional). Enjoy!"
E,"Tips:"
1,"Soaking the bamboo skewers helps prevent them from burning on the grill."
2,"Don't overcrowd the grill while cooking the yakitori. Cook them in batches if necessary."
3,"To check for doneness, insert an internal temperature thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken." The internal temperature should reach 165Â°F for safe consumption."
4,"Leftover yakitori can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them gently in a pan or oven until warmed through."
