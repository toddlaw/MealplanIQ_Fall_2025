A,"Prepare the Asparagus"
1,"Preheat the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400°F / 200°C). Lightly oil the grate for easier cleaning."
2,"Prepare the Asparagus: Wash and trim the asparagus spears. Snap off the woody ends by bending the lower third of each spear until it breaks naturally."
3,Season the Asparagus: In a large bowl, toss the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper."
B,"Optional Lemon Zest"
4,"Zest the Lemon (Optional):** Using a fine-grained grater, zest the lemon directly over the asparagus in the bowl. Be sure to avoid the white pith, as it can be bitter." 
5,"Grill the Asparagus:** Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer on the preheated grill. Grill for 3-5 minutes per side, or until tender-crisp and slightly charred. You can turn the asparagus with tongs or a grill spatula."
6,"Serve with Lemon and Parmesan:** Once cooked, transfer the asparagus to a serving plate. Squeeze fresh lemon juice from the zested lemon (or a fresh lemon) over the asparagus.  Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese."
7,"Enjoy:** Serve the grilled asparagus with lemon and Parmesan cheese hot as a delicious side dish or vegetarian main course."
