step,instruction
Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the vegetables: Julienne the carrot, red bell pepper, and yellow onion. Thinly slice the shiitake mushrooms. Rinse the baby spinach."
2,"Marinate the beef: In a bowl, combine the thinly sliced flank steak with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil, and a pinch of white pepper. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for deeper flavor."
3,"Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the Korean sweet potato noodles (dangmyeon) and cook according to package instructions, usually for 5-7 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse them thoroughly under cold running water to stop the cooking process. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and toss gently to prevent sticking."
4,"Cook the beef: Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Once hot, add the marinated beef and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through to your desired doneness. Remove the cooked beef from the pan and set aside."
5,"Sauté the vegetables: In the same pan used for cooking the beef, add a little more oil if needed. Add the julienned carrots, red bell pepper, and yellow onion. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until softened slightly."
6,"Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook for an additional minute."
7,"Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
8,"Deglaze the pan (optional): Add a splash of water or broth to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
9,"Add the cooked noodles, remaining soy sauce (1 tablespoon), and sugar to the pan with the vegetables. Toss everything together to combine and heat through for about 1-2 minutes."
10,"Incorporate the spinach: Add the rinsed baby spinach and cook just until wilted, about 30 seconds."
11,"Assemble and serve: Transfer the japchae to a serving plate. Arrange the cooked beef slices on top. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions (optional). Serve hot!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the amount of vegetables depending on your preference."
2,"Feel free to substitute the flank steak with other protein options like chicken breast, tofu, or shrimp."
3,"If you don't have dangmyeon (Korean sweet potato noodles), you can use glass noodles (cellophane noodles) but the texture might be slightly different."
