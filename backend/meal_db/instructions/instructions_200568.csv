1, "Preheat oven to 425°F."
2, "Wash and peel the russet potatoes."
3, "Grate the potatoes using the coarse side of a box grater or the shredding attachment of a food processor. Alternatively, you can finely chop the potatoes with a knife, but the texture won't be quite the same."
4, "Place the grated potatoes in a large colander or cheesecloth-lined bowl. Squeeze out as much excess moisture from the potatoes as possible. This is important for achieving crispy tater tots."
5, "Transfer the grated potatoes to a large bowl. Add the melted butter, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine well."
6, "Gradually add the all-purpose flour, ¼ cup at a time, until the mixture is just able to hold its shape and is no longer sticky. You may not need all of the flour."
7, "Form the potato mixture into small cylinders or tots, about 1-inch long and ½-inch wide. Wet your hands slightly to prevent sticking if needed."
8, "Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of potato mixture in the oil - it should sizzle and start to float within seconds."
9, "Fry the tater tots in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
10, "Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried tater tots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
11, "Once all the tater tots are fried, place them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until heated through."
12, "Serve the tater tots hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup or ranch dressing."
