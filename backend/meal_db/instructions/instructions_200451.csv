1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar (if using), and salt."
2,"Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Crack the eggs into the well and whisk them together until blended."
3,"Gradually whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until a smooth batter forms. There should be no lumps. If the batter seems too thick, whisk in a little more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches a pourable consistency (about the consistency of heavy cream)."
4,"Stir in the melted butter until incorporated."
5,"Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the gluten in the flour to relax, resulting in thinner and more tender crepes."
6,"Heat a lightly oiled non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. You can test if the pan is hot enough by flicking a few drops of water onto the surface. If the water sizzles and evaporates quickly, the pan is hot enough."
7,"For each crepe, pour about ¼ cup of batter into the hot pan, tilting the pan to swirl the batter and coat the bottom evenly."
8,"Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, or until the edges of the crepe begin to curl and the bottom is golden brown. Use a spatula to loosen the edges and carefully flip the crepe."
9,"Cook for another 30-60 seconds on the other side, or until lightly browned. You can adjust the cooking time depending on how thin or thick you prefer your crepes."
10,"Slide the cooked crepe onto a plate and cover it with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm while you cook the remaining batter."
11,"Repeat steps 6-10 to cook the remaining crepes."
12,"Serve crepes warm filled with your favorite sweet or savory fillings. Some popular options include whipped cream and fresh fruit, Nutella, lemon juice and sugar, ham and cheese, or vegetables and béchamel sauce."
