Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the dipping sauce (optional): In a small bowl, whisk together a raw egg with a splash of soy sauce (optional) for dipping the cooked sukiyaki ingredients."
2,"Make the sukiyaki broth: In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the dashi stock, soy sauce, mirin, sake (if using), and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves."
3,"Prepare the vegetables: Thinly slice the napa cabbage, scallions, and shiitake mushrooms. Separate the enoki mushrooms. Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes."
4,"Cook the sukiyaki (in batches if necessary): Keep the pot of broth simmering on the table over a portable burner. Arrange a small amount of the sliced beef, napa cabbage, and enoki mushrooms in the simmering broth. You can cook the ingredients in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot."
5,"Cook until tender: Cook the ingredients for a few seconds, or until the beef is just cooked through and the vegetables are slightly softened. Use chopsticks or a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked ingredients to a serving plate."
6,"Repeat with remaining ingredients: Repeat step 4 and 5 with the remaining sliced beef, vegetables, tofu, and shirataki noodles (if using)."
7,"Enjoy!: Dip the cooked sukiyaki ingredients into the beaten egg mixture (if using) or directly into the flavorful broth before enjoying."
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Dashi stock is a Japanese soup stock that adds umami flavor. You can find it at most Asian grocery stores or substitute with water and pre-made dashi powder following package instructions." 
2,"Sake adds a subtle depth of flavor, but it's optional."
3,"You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and sugar to your taste preference for a saltier or sweeter sukiyaki broth."
4,"Be careful not to overcook the thinly sliced beef, as it should be cooked just through for the best texture."
