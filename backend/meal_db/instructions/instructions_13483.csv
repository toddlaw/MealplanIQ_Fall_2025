1,"Heat milk in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, then add beaten eggs slowly while stirring constantly. Continue stirring gently until the mixture reaches a scrambled egg-like consistency. Be cautious as the mixture can scorch easily."
2,"Strain the mixture through cheesecloth into a bowl, tie the cheesecloth tightly, and let it drain by suspending it over a bowl or sink faucet for 1 to 2 hours. Place the cheesecloth on a cooling rack over a bowl, and place a heavy object on top to press out the liquid, such as a cast iron skillet weighted with heavy cans. Press for approximately 2 hours."
