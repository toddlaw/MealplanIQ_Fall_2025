1,"Mix the flour, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Use a fork to incorporate white wine until a dough ball forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, approximately 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for around 2 hours."
2,"Roll out 1/3 of the dough thinly into a large circle on a lightly floured surface. Cut it into 8 (5-inch) circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli form, and secure with egg yolk. Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C)."
3,Fry 2 or 3 pieces at a time until they turn golden brown. Use tongs to transfer them to paper towels to drain. Remove shells from the forms while still hot to prevent sticking.
4,"The nutritional value of the fried oil is based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Exact amounts may vary based on factors such as cooking time, temperature, ingredient density, and the type of oil used."
