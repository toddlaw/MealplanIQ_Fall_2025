1, "Prepare the Brine: In a large pot, combine water and coarse sea salt for the brine. Bring the brine to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat and let cool completely."
2, "Wash the garlic chives thoroughly in cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Trim off the root ends."
3, "Optional Step: If using Korean radish and carrot, julienne them into thin matchsticks."
4, "In a separate large bowl, combine the garlic chives, julienned radish and carrot (if using), and water. Stir in the gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) according to your desired spice level."
5, "Pour the cooled brine over the garlic chives mixture in the bowl. Ensure everything is submerged. Weigh down the mixture with a plate or other heavy object to keep it submerged. Brine for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator."
6, "After brining, drain the garlic chives mixture in a colander. Rinse them briefly under cold running water to remove some of the saltiness. Squeeze out any excess liquid with your hands or a clean kitchen towel."
7, "In a clean bowl, combine the drained garlic chives, fish sauce, sugar, minced garlic, and minced ginger. Toss well to coat the garlic chives evenly with the seasonings."
8, "Transfer the seasoned garlic chives to an airtight container or jar. Press down to remove any air pockets. Seal the container tightly."
9, "Let the Buchu Jangajji ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days. The fermentation time can vary depending on the desired level of sourness. Taste the kimchi periodically to determine your preference."
10, "Once fermented to your liking, transfer the Buchu Jangajji to the refrigerator for storage. It will continue to mature and develop flavor over time. It's best enjoyed after at least a few days of refrigeration, but can be stored for several weeks."
11, "Serve Buchu Jangajji cold as a side dish with Korean meals. It pairs well with grilled meats, stews, or rice bowls."
