2,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
3,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to thicken the sauce."
