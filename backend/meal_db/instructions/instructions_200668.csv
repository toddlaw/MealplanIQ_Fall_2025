Step,Instruction
1,"Soaking the Beans (Optional): While not necessary, soaking the beans overnight can help shorten the cooking time and make them more digestible. Rinse the dried beans thoroughly in a colander. Pick out any debris or discolored beans. Transfer the beans to a large bowl, cover them with at least 4 inches of water, and soak for 8-12 hours. If you choose to skip soaking, proceed to step 2."
2,"In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the rinsed or soaked beans, diced onion, minced garlic, and water. Add the bay leaves."
3,"Optional Step: If using fresh epazote leaves, tie them up with kitchen twine to create a bundle and add them to the pot. You can remove the bundle later before serving."
4,"Optional Step: Drizzle in olive oil for added flavor."
5,"Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer for 1 ½ - 3 hours, or until the beans are tender and creamy. The cooking time can vary depending on the type of bean and whether they were soaked beforehand."
6,"Seasoning: After about 1 ½ hours of simmering, add the kosher salt to taste. You can start with ½ tablespoon and add more gradually to your preference. Be cautious, as the saltiness can concentrate as the beans continue to cook."
7,"Checking for Doneness:** Throughout the cooking process, check the beans for doneness. They should be easily mashed between your fingers. If the beans are not tender yet but the liquid is starting to reduce too much, add more hot water as needed."
8,"Optional Step: Once the beans are cooked, you can remove the bay leaves and the epazote bundle (if used) with a spoon."
9,"Serving: Serve Frijoles de la Olla hot as a main dish with warm tortillas, or as a side dish with other Mexican meals. You can enjoy them as is, or mash them slightly with a potato masher for a thicker consistency."
10,"Leftovers: Store leftover Frijoles de la Olla in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of water or broth if needed to thin the consistency."
