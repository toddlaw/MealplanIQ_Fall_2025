step,instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts of water)."
2,"While the water heats up, prepare your garnishes (optional). Toast pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few minutes, watching closely to prevent burning. Set aside to cool slightly."
3,"Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes)."
4,"Reserve about Â½ cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta completely. This starchy water will help create a smooth and creamy sauce."
5,"While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic (if using) and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
6,"Do not let the garlic brown.** Reduce heat to low if necessary."
7,"Drain the cooked pasta and immediately add it to the hot skillet with the olive oil (and garlic, if using)."
8,"Immediately add the pesto sauce to the pan with the pasta.** Toss the pasta and sauce together for 1-2 minutes, or until the pasta is well coated."
9,"If the sauce seems too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water at a time, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach a desired creamy consistency."
10,"Season the pasta with salt and black pepper (to taste) to taste."
11,"Turn off the heat and transfer the pesto pasta to warmed bowls for serving."
12,"Garnish with additional pesto (optional), grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, toasted pine nuts (optional), and fresh basil leaves (optional). Enjoy!"
