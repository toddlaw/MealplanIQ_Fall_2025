step,instruction
1,"Trim any excess fat from the pork shoulder. Cut the pork shoulder into 3-4 inch chunks."
2,"In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, combine pork shoulder, chicken broth, orange juice, lime juice, quartered onion, whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, cumin, oregano, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to coat the pork with the seasonings."
3,"Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 3-4 hours, or until the pork is very tender and easily shreds with two forks."
4,"Optional Crisping Step: Preheat oven to 400°F. Carefully remove the pork from the cooking liquid using a slotted spoon and transfer it to a baking sheet. Shred the pork with two forks, discarding the bay leaves and garlic cloves. Spread the shredded pork in a single layer on the baking sheet."
5,"Pour about 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid over the shredded pork (enough to moisten but not submerge it). Drizzle the pork with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for added crispiness (optional). Toss the pork to coat evenly."
6,"Bake the shredded pork for 10-15 minutes at 400°F, or until the edges are slightly golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to overcook and dry out the pork."
7,"Slow Cooker Option: If using a slow cooker, transfer all the ingredients from step 2 to your slow cooker. Cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 5-6 hours, or until the pork is very tender and shreds easily with two forks. Shred the pork directly in the slow cooker after cooking and discard the bay leaves and garlic cloves. You can then follow steps 4-6 for the optional crisping step, transferring the shredded pork to a baking sheet and broiling in the oven."
8,"Serve the carnitas warm with your desired toppings on warm tortillas. Some popular options include chopped cilantro, diced white onion, sliced avocado, chopped pineapple, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and lime wedges."
