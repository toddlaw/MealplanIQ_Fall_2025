1,"In a large bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, flour, and salt. Create a well in the middle and add melted butter, egg whites, heavy cream, and vanilla. Stir until thoroughly mixed. Cover and chill for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight."
2,"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray or shortening."
3,"Scoop a generous tablespoon of dough onto one of the greased baking sheets. With the back of a spoon, flatten the batter into a thin oval measuring about 6 inches by 3 1/2 inches. You can make up to 4 ovals per sheet (it's important to shape them quickly after baking)."
4,"Bake until the edges start to brown, approximately 6 minutes. Carefully lift one cookie off the baking sheet using a long metal knife or spatula and transfer it to a clean surface. Take a chopstick or a thin wooden dowel and roll the cookie up from the long side. Continue this process with the rest of the cookies. If the cookies become too firm to roll, return the baking sheet to the oven for around 30 seconds."
5,"Prepare the second baking sheet while the first one is in the oven. Keep baking and shaping cookies until all the batter is finished. Allow them to cool on a wire rack."
6,"In a bowl placed over simmering water, mix together the chocolate, corn syrup, and the remaining 1/4 cup of butter. Stir occasionally until the mixture is melted and smooth. Allow it to cool slightly. Dip approximately 1 inch of the end of each cookie into the chocolate sauce and let the cookies rest on waxed paper to firm up."
