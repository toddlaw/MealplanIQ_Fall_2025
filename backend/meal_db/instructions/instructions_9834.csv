1,"In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves."

3,"Fry several slices at a time in the buttered skillet until each side is golden brown. Add additional butter to the skillet and proceed with the leftover slices. Melt the remaining butter in the microwave in 15-second intervals. Transfer the completed toast to plates, drizzle with melted butter, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar."
