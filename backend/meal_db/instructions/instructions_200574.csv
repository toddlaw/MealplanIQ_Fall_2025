1,"Prepare all your vegetables by washing, chopping, and cutting them into similar bite-sized pieces. This will ensure even cooking."
2,"In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water to form a slurry."
3,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and ginger (if using) and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
4,"Optional: If using cooked protein, add it to the wok or skillet and stir-fry for a minute or two to heat through."

10,"Optional: Add a pinch of red chili flakes for extra spice."
