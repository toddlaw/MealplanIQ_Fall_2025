1,"Slice the chicken breasts into thin strips against the grain. This ensures the meat cooks quickly and stays tender."
2,"In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk to create a marinade."
3,"Add the sliced chicken to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight for deeper flavor."
4,"Heat a large skillet or grill pan over high heat. If using a grill pan, lightly oil the ridges."
5,"While the pan heats, remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade."
6,"Sauté the sliced bell peppers and red onion in the hot pan for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and slightly charred."
7,"Remove the vegetables from the pan and set them aside on a plate."
8,"Increase the heat to high and add the marinated chicken. Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked through (165°F internal temperature)."
9,"Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes on a cutting board tented with foil. This allows the juices to redistribute for a more tender result."
10,"Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave for a few seconds until softened and pliable."
11,"Slice the rested chicken thinly against the grain again."
12,"To assemble the fajitas, spread some warmed tortillas with your desired toppings (cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cilantro). Add a portion of seasoned chicken and vegetables. Roll up the tortillas and enjoy!"
