1,"Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
2,"Make the dough: Cut 1/2 cup of butter into 1 cup of flour using a knife or pastry cutter. Add 1 tablespoon of water (or adjust as necessary) and mix until the mixture is crumbly, with pea-sized pieces remaining. Roll the dough out on a floured surface to a width of 3 or 4 inches. Transfer it onto a rectangular cookie sheet."
3,"Make the filling: In a small saucepan over high heat, combine 1 cup water and 1/2 cup butter and bring to a boil. Take it off the heat and mix in the remaining 1 cup flour until smooth. Incorporate the eggs one by one, ensuring to mix well after each addition. Stir in 1 teaspoon of almond extract. Spread the filling over the dough."
