1,"In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together 1/2 cup flour, seasoned salt, thyme, and ground black pepper. Coat the chicken pieces in this mixture and fry them in shortening in a large skillet until they are lightly browned on all sides."
2,"Sprinkle paprika and garlic salt over the chicken. Pour hot water into the skillet and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Place onion rings on top of the chicken pieces and continue to simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken, with onions on top, to a serving dish and keep warm."
3,"In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of flour with milk and add it to the liquid in the skillet. Cook while stirring until the mixture thickens. Pour the thickened sauce over the chicken and serve with hot cooked white rice or egg noodles, if preferred."
