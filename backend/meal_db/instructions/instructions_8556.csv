1,"Remove the stems and leaves from the beets, leaving the skins intact. Submerge the beets in cold water and bring to a boil in a large pot. Boil until they are tender when pierced with a fork, approximately 40 minutes."
2,"Drain the beets, reserving two cups of the cooking liquid. Strain the liquid and transfer it to a large saucepan. Peel the beets and grate them using the coarsest side of a grater. Mix the grated beets into the beet liquid. Add the beef broth, onion, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and lower the heat. Let it simmer for 20 minutes before removing from the heat."
3,"Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until cold, before serving. Ladle into bowls and garnish each serving with cucumber and a generous scoop of sour cream."
