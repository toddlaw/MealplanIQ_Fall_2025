1,"Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from the heat. Add the 4 tablespoons of butter and stir until melted. Allow the mixture to cool until it is lukewarm."
2,"Combine lukewarm milk and melted butter. Pour the mixture into the bread machine pan, and add eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Set the machine to the Dough setting and start it."
3,"Allow the dough to rise in the bread machine pan covered with a towel until doubled in size, about 45 minutes after finishing mixing."
4,"Punch down the dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into loaves, and place them into two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled, approximately 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
5,"Combine 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/3 cup flour in a small bowl. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water."
6,"Brush the egg wash on the risen loaves of bread, then sprinkle the crumb topping over them. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 30 minutes or until golden brown."
