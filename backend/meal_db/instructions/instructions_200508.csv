Part A,"For the Gochujang Sauce"
1,"Make the Gochujang Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the gochujang paste, mirin, rice vinegar, soy sauce, white sugar, grated garlic, and toasted sesame oil. Set aside."
Part B,"For the Bibimbap"
2,"Cook the rice: According to package instructions, cook the short-grain white rice. Let it sit for 10 minutes after cooking to fluff up the grains."
3,"Marinate the beef (optional): In a bowl, combine the ground beef, soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and minced garlic. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight, for deeper flavor."
4,"Cook the beef: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated ground beef and cook until browned and cooked through, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat."
5,"Prepare the vegetables:** While the beef cooks, blanch the spinach in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze out any excess water and roughly chop. If using regular spinach, wash and chop it finely."
6,"Squeeze out the excess water from the soaked shiitake mushrooms. Discard the stems and thinly slice the caps."
7,"Julienne the carrots into thin matchsticks."
8,"Rinse and drain the bean sprouts."
Part C,"Assemble the Bibimbap"
9,"Heat a separate pan over medium heat. Add a little oil and cook the julienned carrots and shiitake mushrooms until tender-crisp, about 5-7 minutes."
10,"Divide the cooked rice evenly among three or four bowls."
11,"Top each bowl with the cooked ground beef, blanched spinach, cooked carrots and mushrooms, and bean sprouts. Arrange the toppings in sections around the perimeter of the bowl for a visually appealing presentation."
12,"Add a fried egg on top of each bowl."
13,"Drizzle the Gochujang sauce generously over each bowl."
14,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped scallions for extra flavor and texture."
15,"Serve: Serve the bibimbap hot with kimchi (optional) on the side. Enjoy mixing all the ingredients together in each bite!"
Part D,"Notes"
1,"You can substitute ground beef with other protein options like thinly sliced marinated chicken, tofu cubes, or even cooked shrimp."
2,"Feel free to adjust the amount of Gochujang sauce depending on your spice preference."
3,"If you don't have a dolsot (hot stone bowl) for serving, regular bowls work just fine."
