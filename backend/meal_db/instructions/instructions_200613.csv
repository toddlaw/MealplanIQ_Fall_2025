Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Dough"
1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until the yeast becomes foamy and active."
2,"Stir in the olive oil and 2.5 cups of the flour. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Add the salt and continue mixing until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. You may need to add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is no longer sticky but still slightly soft."
3,"First Rise:** Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size."
B,"Shape the Focaccia"
4,"Preheat Oven: While the dough rises, preheat your oven to 425Â°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking sheet with olive oil."
5,"Stretch and Dimple the Dough:**  Gently transfer the risen dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Use your fingertips to gently stretch and dimple the dough evenly to fill the pan. It should be about 1/2 inch thick."
C,"Second Rise and Topping"
6,"Second Rise: Cover the stretched dough loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30 minutes."
7,"Optional Toppings: After the second rise, gently brush the top of the dough with olive oil.  If using, arrange the rosemary sprigs on top of the dough and sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt."
8,"Bake:** Bake the focaccia bread in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crusty on top."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
9,"Cool Slightly:** Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack before slicing and serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature."
