1,"Remove the pot from heat and let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the curds to form completely."
2,"Gather the cheesecloth edges and twist to form a pouch; press to remove excess liquid. Rinse the curds under cold water to remove any remaining whey. Place the curds in a bowl and add salt to taste; mix well."
3,"Transfer the strained curds to a food processor. Process until smooth and the mixture can be shaped into a ball. If the mixture is too dry, add some of the reserved liquid and process again. The consistency should be similar to that of firm ricotta cheese."
4,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease a baking dish."
5,"To prepare paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the paneer into bite-sized pieces and fry them in the hot oil until they are very pale golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels."
