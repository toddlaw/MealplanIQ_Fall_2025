Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the Tofu: Drain the tofu and cut it into bite-sized cubes (about 1/2 inch). Gently press the tofu cubes between paper towels to remove any excess moisture."
2,"Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the tofu cubes and blanch for 2-3 minutes. This helps to firm up the texture of the tofu."
3,"Drain the tofu cubes and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside."
4,"Rehydrate the Shiitake Mushrooms (if not already done): Place the dried shiitake mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or until softened. Remove the mushrooms from the soaking liquid and reserve the soaking liquid (shiitake broth)."
5,"Strain the soaking liquid from the shiitake mushrooms through a cheesecloth or fine-mesh sieve to remove any grit. Set the shiitake broth aside."
6,"Slice the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms and the cremini mushrooms (or other chosen mushrooms)."
7,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large wok or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
8,"Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cremini mushrooms to the wok and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened slightly."
9,"Pour in the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (if using), vegetable broth, reserved shiitake broth (about 1/2 cup), and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer."
10,"Optional: In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering braising liquid to thicken it slightly."
11,"Gently add the blanched tofu cubes to the wok and stir to coat them in the sauce."
12,"Simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the tofu is heated through and the flavors have developed."
13,"Optional: Drizzle in the sesame oil for an extra layer of flavor (optional)."
14,"Turn off the heat and taste the braised tofu. Adjust seasonings with additional soy sauce, sugar, or sesame oil (optional) to your preference."
15,"Serve the braised tofu with mushrooms hot over rice. Garnish with chopped scallions (green onions) and sesame seeds (optional)."
16,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 2-3 servings. You can use any type of mushrooms you like in this recipe. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through."
