1,"In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, and salt; set aside."
2,"In a small bowl, combine the rosemary, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture onto both sides of the chicken breasts and set aside."
3,"Melt butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts, cover the skillet, and sautï¿½ for about 5 minutes on each side until lightly browned. Pour the orange-maple mixture over the chicken (the mixture will boil and bubble). Reduce the heat to a simmer; cover and let cook for another 10 minutes, basting occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened into a rich glaze."
