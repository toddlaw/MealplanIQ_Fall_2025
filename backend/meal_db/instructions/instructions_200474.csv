1,"Preheat your oven to 375°F."
2,"In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking them up with a spoon as they cook, until browned."
3,"Drain any excess fat from the skillet."
4,"Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes."
5,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant."
6,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), and water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to thicken the sauce."
7,"While the sauce simmers, in a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, ½ cup of the grated Parmesan cheese, and a splash of milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This is your cheese mixture."
8,"In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining milk with a tablespoon of melted butter (optional) to create a milk mixture." 
9,"If using no-boil lasagna noodles, follow the package instructions for pre-cooking, if necessary. If using traditional lasagna noodles, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water."
10,"Assemble the lasagna in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish. Top with a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles."
11,"Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with some grated Parmesan cheese."
12,"Repeat layers of meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and Parmesan cheese, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese."
13,"Pour the milk mixture evenly over the top layer of cheese."
14,"Bake the lasagna for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are bubbling and the cheese is golden brown."
15,"Let the lasagna cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to set and prevents it from falling apart."
16,"Optional: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving."
17,"Enjoy your delicious and hearty Meat Lasagna!"
