Step,Instruction
1,"Blend ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and garlic salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Shape the mixture into eight thin patties, each slightly larger than a slice of cheese."
2,Layer cheese slices in four stacks and cut each stack into four squares. Place one stack in the center of a beef patty. Cover with another patty and press the edges securely to seal around the cheese. Be sure to seal tightly to avoid cheese leakage during cooking. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.
3,"Cook the patties in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until browned on one side. Flip the patties, poke the tops, and continue cooking until browned on the other side, ensuring they are no longer pink in the center. Use an instant-read thermometer to confirm the internal temperature reaches at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
4,Serve the patties on hamburger buns.
