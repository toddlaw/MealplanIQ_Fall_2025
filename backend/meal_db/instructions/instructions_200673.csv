Step,Instruction
1,"In a large bowl, combine the shredded cabbage, chopped red bell pepper, white onion, and chopped cilantro."
2,"Optional Step: If using a jalape√±o pepper, seed and mince it finely. Add it to the bowl for a spicy kick. Adjust the amount based on your preference."
3,"In a separate small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, olive oil, apple cider vinegar (if using), salt, and black pepper (optional) to create a dressing."
4,"Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat all ingredients evenly."
5,"Taste the coleslaw and adjust seasonings with additional lime juice, salt, or black pepper as desired."
6,"Optional Step: For added protein and texture, you can incorporate black beans (drained and rinsed), corn (drained), crumbled Cotija cheese, or diced avocado to the coleslaw mixture. Fold them in gently to avoid breaking the avocado."
7,"Cover the bowl and refrigerate the Ensalada de Repollo for at least 30 minutes before serving. Chilling allows the flavors to meld and the cabbage to soften slightly."
8,"Serve Mexican Coleslaw cold as a refreshing side dish with tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or other Mexican-inspired meals."
