step,instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta."
2,"While the water heats, heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat."
3,"Add the shallots (or onion) and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent browning."
4,"Increase the heat to medium-high and add the garlic. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant."
5,"Pour in the white wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the wine to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly reduced."
6,"Add the red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper to the pan. Stir to combine."
7,"Optional: Add a squeeze of lemon juice to the pan at this point for a touch of brightness (to taste)."
8,"Increase the heat to high and add the clams to the pan. Toss to coat the clams in the sauce."
9,"Cover the pot tightly and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the clams open. Discard any clams that remain unopened."
10,"Meanwhile, cook the linguine according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about Â½ cup of the pasta water before draining."
11,"Once the clams are open, add the chopped fresh parsley (except for the reserved garnish) and lemon zest to the pot. Toss to combine."
12,"Immediately drain the cooked pasta and add it to the pot with the clam sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sauce."
13,"If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until your desired consistency is reached."
14,"Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter until melted and incorporated into the sauce."
15,"Season the linguine with clams with additional salt and pepper to taste (if needed)."
16,"Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining chopped fresh parsley."
