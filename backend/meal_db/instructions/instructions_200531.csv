6,"Stir in chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), oregano, salt, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices."
7,"Pour in crushed tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
8,"Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens slightly."
