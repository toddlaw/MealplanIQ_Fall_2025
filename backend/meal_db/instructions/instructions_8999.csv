1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 12-cup muffin pans or line the cups with paper liners."

3,"Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups, ensuring each is filled about three-quarters full."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven until the tops bounce back when gently pressed, approximately 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool in the tins for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."
