1,"Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, honey, ginger, garlic, and black pepper. Add the chicken thighs and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight."
2,"Cook the chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Sear the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown."
3,"Make the teriyaki sauce: In a separate saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Pour in the remaining marinade from the bowl and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly."
4,"Thicken the sauce (optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water to make a slurry. Slowly whisk the slurry into the simmering sauce until it reaches your desired consistency."
5,"Serve: Transfer the chicken back to the pan and coat it with the teriyaki sauce. Serve immediately with rice and steamed vegetables, or your favorite sides."
