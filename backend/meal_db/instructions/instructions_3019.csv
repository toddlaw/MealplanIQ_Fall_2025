1,"Prepare all the necessary ingredients."
2,"Combine 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a sizable bowl. Let it rest for a duration of 30 minutes."
3,"Rephrase the dough by combining the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, the leftover 1/2 cup of warm water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, vegetable oil, and salt. Until the dough is smooth and elastic, knead it."
4,"Move the dough into a bowl coated with oil, ensuring the dough is lightly covered with oil as well, and allow it to rise until it has tripled in size, usually taking about 2 1/2 to 3 hours."
5,"Deflate the dough and move it onto a flour-dusted surface. Evenly distribute baking powder on top of the dough and knead for 5 minutes."
6,"Take the initial half of the dough and split it into 12 evenly distributed portions."
7,"Reform each piece into a sphere; shift each sphere to a little waxed paper square with the smooth side facing upwards. Repeat the portioning and molding process with the leftover half of the dough. Protect all 24 dough spheres and allow them to rest until they double in size, which usually takes around 30 minutes."
8,"Cover the wok and steam buns over medium heat until expanded and puffy, about 15 minutes. Repeat steaming with the remaining buns, adding hot water into the wok if necessary."
9,"Carefully lift the cover to avoid dropping the condensation onto the buns. Proceed to steam the remaining buns until all are fully cooked."
