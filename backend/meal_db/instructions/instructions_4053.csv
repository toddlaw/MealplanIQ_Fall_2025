1,"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)."
2,"Put the chicken upright on a rack in a roasting pan. Make 10 slits in the skin with a sharp knife, pulling the skin back away from the meat; insert a garlic clove into each slit. Rub the masala powder over the entire chicken. Squeeze lime juice over the chicken, then turn it breast side down in the roasting pan, placing the rind inside the chicken cavity."
3,"Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking until the meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, approximately 45 additional minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should indicate 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Once done, take the chicken out of the oven, cover it with two layers of aluminum foil, and let it rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing."
