1,"Place a large pot of salted water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add the russet potatoes and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot."
2,"While the potatoes are cooking, chop the celery, red onion, dill pickles, and fresh dill (if using)."
3,"In a separate bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and black pepper."
4,"Once the potatoes are cooked and drained, mash them slightly with a potato masher (leaving some chunks for texture). Alternatively, you can use a fork or a hand mixer for a smoother texture."
5,"Add the chopped celery, red onion, dill pickles, and fresh dill (if using) to the mashed potatoes."
6,"Pour the dressing over the potato mixture and toss gently to coat evenly. Be careful not to overmix or the potatoes will become mushy."
7,"Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Cover the potato salad and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to develop."
8,"Serve chilled or at room temperature. Garnish with a pinch of paprika (optional)."
