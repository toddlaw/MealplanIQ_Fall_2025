1,"Marinate the Shrimp: In a medium bowl, toss the raw shrimp with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tender shrimp."
2,"Prepare the Vegetables: Julienne the red bell pepper and celery stalks (optional) for a colorful stir-fry."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Sear the Shrimp: Add the marinated shrimp to the hot wok and spread them out in a single layer. Sear the shrimp for 1-2 minutes per side, or until pink and cooked through. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become tough."
5,"Remove the Shrimp: Once cooked, transfer the seared shrimp to a plate and set aside."
6,"Stir-fry the Vegetables: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the julienned red bell pepper and celery (optional) and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened."
7,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and white pepper. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and water to your preference for saltiness and desired sauce consistency."
8,"Add the Sauce: Pour the prepared sauce into the wok with the vegetables."
9,"Return the Shrimp: Add the cooked shrimp back to the wok with the sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the shrimp in the sauce."
10,"Simmer for a Minute: Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for an additional minute, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the ingredients."
11,"Stir in the Cashews: Add the roasted and salted cashews to the wok and stir gently to combine."
12,"Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped scallions. Serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious shrimp stir-fry with cashews!"
