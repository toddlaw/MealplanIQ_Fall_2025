Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Burdock Root"
1,"Scrub and Shave the Gobo:  Scrub the outside of the burdock root with a stiff brush or vegetable peeler to remove any dirt.  Wear gloves as burdock root can irritate your skin.  Using a sharp knife or mandoline, thinly julienne the burdock root into long, slender matchsticks."
2,"Soak the Gobo (Optional):  Soaking the gobo in water can help to remove some of the bitterness.  Place the julienned burdock root in a large bowl of cold water and soak for 15-20 minutes.  Rinse the gobo well and drain thoroughly."
B,"Prepare the Vegetables"
3,"Julienne the Carrots: Julienne the carrots into matchsticks similar in size to the burdock root."
4,"Optional Shiitake Mushrooms: If using shiitake mushrooms, rehydrate them by soaking them in hot water for 15 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, discard the stems, and thinly slice the caps."
C,"Sauté the Vegetables"
5,"Heat Oil in a Pan: Heat a mixture of sesame oil and neutral oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat."
6,"Sauté the Gobo: Add the julienned burdock root (gobo) to the hot oil and sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it starts to soften slightly."
7,"Add Carrots and Mushrooms (Optional): Add the julienned carrots and the sliced shiitake mushrooms (if using) to the pan and stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the carrots are slightly softened."
D,"Braising"
8,"Add Seasonings: Add the mirin, soy sauce, and sugar to the pan. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer."
9,"Reduce Heat and Simmer:  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the burdock root and carrots are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent burning."
E,"Serve and Enjoy"
10,"Garnish and Serve: Transfer the cooked kinpira gobo to a serving plate. Garnish with toasted white sesame seeds and your choice of additional garnishes like shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice powder) or a few bonito flakes (katsuobushi) for a touch of smokiness (optional). Serve hot or at room temperature."
F,"Tips:"
1,"Burdock root can be tricky to find fresh, but it is available at some Asian grocery stores. You can also substitute with dried burdock root (which will require additional rehydration steps)."
2,"Kinpira gobo can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors will develop further over time."
