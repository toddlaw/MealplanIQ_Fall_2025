Step,Instruction
1,"Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them well with a fork or whisk until evenly combined."
2,"Add the chopped green onion, julienned carrot (if using), and julienned ham (if using) to the egg mixture. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Whisk gently to combine everything."
3,"Heat a non-stick pan or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Optional Step: If using a non-stick pan, you can skip adding oil."
5,"Pour the egg mixture into the heated pan, tilting the pan to spread the eggs evenly into a thin layer."
6,"Cooking the Omelette: As the edges of the omelette begin to set (usually takes about 30-45 seconds), use a heat-resistant spatula to gently lift and fold a small portion of the cooked egg from the edge towards the center of the pan."
7,"Continue tilting the pan and folding the cooked egg portions towards the center as the remaining liquid egg cooks. You can use chopsticks or a fork to help break up any uncooked egg and push it towards the center."
8,"**Optional Step:** For a thicker and fluffier omelette, remove the pan from heat for a few seconds halfway through cooking to allow the bottom to set slightly before continuing to fold."
9,"Once the eggs are mostly cooked through, with a slight wobble in the center, stop folding. You can adjust the cooking time depending on your preference for a softer or firmer omelette."
10,"Rolling the Omelette: Using your spatula, gently roll the omelette tightly from one end to the other. You can use a chopstick or your fingers to help shape the roll as needed."
11,"Optional Step: If desired, you can gently press down on the rolled omelette with the spatula to achieve a more compact shape."
12,"Slide the rolled omelette onto a plate and serve immediately. You can cut it into bite-sized pieces before serving."
13,"Gyeran Mari can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature as a side dish or a light meal."
