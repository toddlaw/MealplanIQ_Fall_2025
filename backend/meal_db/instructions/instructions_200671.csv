1,"Rinse the white rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch for a fluffier texture."
2,"In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the rinsed rice and stir to coat with oil."
3,"Saut√© the rice for about 1 minute, stirring occasionally, until it becomes slightly translucent."
4,"Add the water, lime zest, salt, and black pepper (if using) to the pot. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat."
5,"Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-17 minutes, or until the rice is tender and cooked through. Do not peek or lift the lid during cooking."
6,"While the rice simmers, prepare the lime juice and cilantro. Finely chop the cilantro leaves and set aside."
7,"After 15-17 minutes, remove the pot from heat and keep it covered for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and absorb any remaining liquid."
8,"Fluff the rice gently with a fork. Stir in the freshly squeezed lime juice and chopped cilantro."
9,"Taste the rice and adjust seasonings with additional salt or lime juice to your preference."
10,"Serve Cilantro Lime Rice hot as a delicious side dish with various Mexican or Tex-Mex inspired meals."
