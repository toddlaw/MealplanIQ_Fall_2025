1,"In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition."
2,"In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. In another large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 cup of confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until smooth and creamy. Gradually stir in the flour mixture, then gently fold in the oatmeal and pecans until just combined."
3,"Using a spoon, place approximately 1 scant tablespoon of dough for each cookie onto the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until they are lightly browned, around 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely before dusting the cookies with confectioners' sugar."
4,"These cookies freeze nicely, so I frequently prepare a double batch. The challenge is placing some into the freezer before they've all been eaten!"
5,"You can substitute walnuts for pecans and use regular oats in place of quick-cooking oats."
