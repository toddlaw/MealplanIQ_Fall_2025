1,"Set the oven to preheat at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
2,"Knead the dough by hand on a lightly floured surface until it becomes smooth. Divide the dough into two equal halves and shape them into balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes."
3,"Prepare the filling: boil 3 cups of water in a pot, then add the lentils and cook for 30 to 45 minutes until they are tender. Monitor the lentils and add more water as needed."
4,"Wrap the potatoes in aluminum foil and bake them for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Once the potatoes have cooled, cut them into small pieces and combine them with the lentils."
5,"Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it into large rounds. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each round, then fold the dough over to create a pocket and seal the edges."
6,"Split the dough into 6 - 8-inch circles. Position the circles on a floured surface. Add one cup of filling to the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling, seal the edges, and place the pasties on a cookie sheet without greasing. Bake for one hour in the preheated oven."
