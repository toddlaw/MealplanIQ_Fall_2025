1,"Prepare the Salad Base: Wash and dry the romaine lettuce. Roughly chop the lettuce leaves and place them in a large bowl."
2,"Optional Step: Make or buy crispy tortilla strips for added texture. You can use store-bought fried tortilla strips or bake your own by cutting corn tortillas into wedges and baking them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy."
3,"Prepare the Dressing: In a blender or food processor, combine the light mayonnaise, olive oil, garlic clove, lime juice, lemon juice, ground cumin, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (optional), salt, and black pepper (optional). Blend until smooth and emulsified."
4,"Pour the dressing over the chopped romaine lettuce in the bowl. Toss gently to coat the salad greens evenly."
5,"Assemble the Salad: Top the dressed salad with crumbled Cotija cheese, sliced or diced avocado, and chopped cilantro leaves."
6,"Optional Step: Add additional toppings of your choice, such as cherry tomatoes (halved), black beans (drained and rinsed), grilled corn kernels, sliced red onion, or pickled jalapeños."
7,"Serve Mexican Caesar Salad immediately while fresh. Enjoy with lime wedges for squeezing extra citrus flavor over the salad."
