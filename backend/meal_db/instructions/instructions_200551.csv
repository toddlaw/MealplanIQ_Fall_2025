1,"Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly. Peel the potatoes if desired, or leave the skin on for added nutrients."
2,"Cut the potatoes into sticks. Aim for a thickness of about 1/2 inch for thicker fries or 1/4 inch for thinner fries. You can use a knife or a mandoline for more uniform slices."
3,"Fill a large bowl with cold water and add the sliced potatoes. Soak the potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. Soaking helps remove excess starch for crispier fries."
4,"Drain the potatoes in a colander and rinse them thoroughly with cold water. Pat the potatoes dry with clean paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Dry fries will crisp up better."
5,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. The oil temperature should reach 325°F (163°C) for a double fry or 375°F (190°C) for a single fry. You can use a deep fryer thermometer to monitor the temperature."
6,"Optional Vinegar Soak (for double fry): While the oil heats up, you can optionally soak the potatoes in a mixture of cold water and vinegar for 5-10 minutes. This can help achieve extra crispy fries. Drain and dry the potatoes thoroughly again after soaking."
7,"**Double Fry Method (for extra crispy fries): Fry the potatoes in batches for 2-3 minutes per batch, or until they are slightly softened and par-cooked but not browned. Remove the fries from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels."
8,"Increase the oil temperature to 375°F for the second fry. Once the oil reaches the desired temperature, fry the par-cooked potatoes in batches again for 2-3 minutes per batch, or until golden brown and crispy."
9,"Single Fry Method: Alternatively, you can fry the potatoes in a single fry at 375°F for 5-7 minutes per batch, or until golden brown and crispy. This method is faster but may not yield fries that are as crispy as the double fry method."
10,"Season the fries immediately after removing them from the oil with salt and black pepper (or your desired seasonings) to taste. Serve the fries hot and enjoy!"
