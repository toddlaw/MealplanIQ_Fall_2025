1,"Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, cumin, and curry powder; cook and stir until the onion is softened and translucent, approximately 5 minutes. Incorporate the garbanzo beans, red bell pepper, turnip, corn, and tomato sauce. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender and the curry has thickened, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours."
