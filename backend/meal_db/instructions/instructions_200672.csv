1,"Roasting the Poblano Peppers: There are two methods for roasting the poblano peppers. Choose your preferred method:"
1a,"Broiler Method: Preheat your broiler to high. Place the poblano peppers directly on the oven rack and broil for 4-5 minutes per side, turning occasionally, until the skin is blackened and blistered all over."
1b,"Stovetop Method: Heat a gas stove burner over medium heat. Place the poblano peppers directly on the burner and roast, turning occasionally with tongs, until the skin is blackened and blistered all over."
2,"Once the peppers are roasted, place them in a paper bag and seal it shut. Let them steam for 10 minutes. This loosens the skin."
3,"Carefully peel off the blackened skin from the peppers. Wear gloves if handling hot peppers."
3a,"After peeling, remove the stem and seeds from the peppers. Rinse the inside of the peppers gently with cold water to remove any remaining seeds or loose skin."
4,"Prepare the Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the shredded cheese (Monterrey Jack cheese is a common choice, but you can also use Queso Fresco or Chihuahua cheese, or a combination). If using, add cream cheese and any optional filling ingredients like roasted corn, chopped cooked spinach, diced cooked ham, or chopped cooked chorizo. Season with salt and black pepper (optional) to taste."
5,"Stuff the roasted poblano peppers with the cheese filling.** Divide the filling evenly among the peppers. You may not need all the filling depending on the size of the peppers."
6,"Prepare the Egg Batter: In a shallow bowl, whisk together the egg whites until frothy and slightly stiff peaks form. Season with a pinch of salt (optional)."
7,"Set up a dredging station: In a separate shallow bowl, place the all-purpose flour."
8,"Dip each stuffed poblano pepper first into the flour, coating it evenly. Gently tap off any excess flour."
9,"Next, dip the floured pepper into the egg batter, fully coating the surface."
10,"Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat (350Â°F)."
10a,"You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of breadcrumb into the hot oil. If it sizzles and floats immediately, the oil is hot enough."
11,"Carefully fry the stuffed peppers, one or two at a time, for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
12,"Drain the fried peppers on paper towels to remove excess oil."
13,"Serve Chiles Rellenos immediately while hot. You can enjoy them on their own or with your favorite salsa, crema, or guacamole on the side."
