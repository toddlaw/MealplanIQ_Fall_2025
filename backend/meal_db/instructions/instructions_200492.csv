1,"Make the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, water, and dashi powder (if using) until a smooth batter forms. The batter should be slightly thicker than pancake batter. Add a little more water if it's too thick, or a little more flour if it's too thin."
2,"Prepare the cabbage: Finely shred the cabbage using a mandoline or sharp knife."
3,"Combine batter and cabbage: In a large bowl, combine the shredded cabbage with the prepared batter. Mix gently to avoid overworking the batter."
4,"Cook the okonomiyaki: Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Brush the pan with a thin layer of vegetable oil."
5,"Form the okonomiyaki: Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter mixture into the pan for each okonomiyaki. Spread it into a round patty shape, about 1/2-inch thick."
6,"Optional fillings: If using any optional fillings like sliced pork belly or seafood, add them on top of the batter mixture in the pan before cooking further."
7,"Cook the first side: Cook the okonomiyaki for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and the bottom is set. You may need to gently press down on the okonomiyaki with a spatula to ensure even cooking."
8,"Flip and cook the second side: Flip the okonomiyaki carefully using a spatula. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown on the other side."
9,"Assemble and serve: Transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to a plate. Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise to taste. Sprinkle with bonito flakes and aonori seaweed flakes."
10,"Optional garnishes: For additional flavor and texture, you can also garnish with beni shoga (red pickled ginger), tenkasu (tempura crumbs), or chopped spring onions (scallions)."
