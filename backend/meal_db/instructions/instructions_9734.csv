Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat 4 one-cup souffle dishes with melted butter and dust the interiors with sugar."
2,"Set the egg yolks aside and place the 4 egg whites into the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat the egg whites along with the salt until they form soft peaks."
3,"Combine the 2 egg yolks, bananas, honey, vanilla extract, and ginger in a blender; pulse until the mixture is smooth."
4,"Spoon the banana mixture into a bowl; with a rubber spatula or wire whisk, gently fold in 1/4 of the beaten egg whites. Carefully sweep the spatula through the middle of the bowl, then along the edges, repeating until everything is combined. Gradually fold in the remaining egg whites, taking care to retain as much air in the mixture as you can."
5,"Scoop the souffle mixture into the prepared dishes; bake in the preheated oven until the souffles rise above the baking dishes and their tops are golden brown, approximately 15 minutes. Dust a small amount of sweetened cocoa powder over each souffle as a garnish before serving."
