Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Polenta (if not already cooked)"
1,"Cook the polenta according to package instructions.** This will typically involve bringing water to a boil, whisking in polenta, and simmering until thickened, stirring frequently.
B,"Prepare the Fried Polenta"
2,"Cool the Polenta: If using leftover polenta, spread it out evenly onto a baking sheet or large plate and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until completely cool and firm.
3,"Cut the Polenta: Once chilled, cut the polenta into desired shapes, such as squares, sticks, or triangles.
4,"Set Up Coating Station: Prepare three shallow bowls in a row. In the first bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. In the second bowl, place the all-purpose flour. In the third bowl, add the panko breadcrumbs.
5,"Season the Polenta (Optional): Sprinkle the cooled polenta slices with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
6,"Dredge the Polenta: Dip each polenta slice into the milk and egg mixture, then coat it evenly in the flour. Next, dredge it in the panko breadcrumbs to achieve a crispy coating.
7,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat to a temperature of 350°F (175°C).
8,"Fry the Polenta: Carefully add a few polenta slices at a time to the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.
9,"Drain on Paper Towels: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried polenta to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
10,"Serve and Enjoy: Serve the fried polenta hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as marinara sauce, pesto, or a simple lemon wedge. You can also sprinkle them with grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
