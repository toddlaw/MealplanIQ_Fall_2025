1,"With a fork, combine confectioners' sugar and flour in a medium-size bowl. Work in the butter until it forms small crumbs. Add in the egg and vanilla and stir until you have a slightly moist dough. Add additional butter if dough is too dry, or add more flour if it seems oily. Form the dough into balls, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and press these balls into tart molds ensuring it covers the base and extends beyond the sides. Using two fingers, shape the edge into a form of letter A."
2,"Set the oven to preheat at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium-sized saucepan, mix in white sugar and water and heat it till it reaches boiling point. Stir until all the sugar crystals melt, then take it off the heat and let it cool till it reaches room temperature. Pour the eggs through a sieve and whisk them into the cooled sugar solution. Incorporate the evaporated milk and vanilla into the mixture. Pass the filling through a sieve once again, then use it to fill up the tart shells."
3,"Cook in the preheated oven until the filling has ballooned slightly and is golden brown, around 15 to 20 minutes."
4,"Evaporated milk can also be replaced with whole milk in this recipe.""
