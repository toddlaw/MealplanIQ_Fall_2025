1,Coat the chicken breast pieces by dredging them in the seasoned flour mixture; shake off any excess flour.
2,"Pan-fry the chicken breast pieces in melted butter over medium heat until they are golden brown, the juices run clear, and the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Remember to turn the chicken pieces often. Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet and keep warm."
3,"Deglaze the skillet with white wine, then add lemon juice and capers to create a flavorful sauce for the chicken. Allow the sauce to simmer until slightly thickened before returning the chicken to the skillet, coating it in the sauce."
4,"To serve, plate the chicken, pour the sauce on top, and decorate with lemon slices and fresh parsley for garnish."
