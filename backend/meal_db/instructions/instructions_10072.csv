3,"Cooking Tip: Melt a teaspoon of butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop about 3 tablespoons of batter and pour it into the skillet. Evenly sprinkle the top of the pancake with about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar. Cook the pancake until the bottom is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancake onto the sugared side and cook until the cinnamon sugar forms a crust, about 3 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter and cinnamon sugar. Allow the pancakes to cool without stacking to maintain the sugar crust's texture."
