1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta. Once boiling, add the penne pasta and cook according to package instructions for al dente."
2,"While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent browning."
3,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
4,"Add the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to allow the tomato paste to bloom and release its flavor."
5,"Pour in the vodka and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the vodka has reduced slightly."
6,"Add the crushed tomatoes (including the juices) and bring the sauce to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste (start with a little and add more to your preference)."
7,"Reduce the heat to low and simmer the vodka sauce for 10-15 minutes, or until slightly thickened. You can simmer for a longer time for a thicker sauce."
8,"Optional: While the sauce simmers, you can shred or grate the Parmesan cheese."
9,"Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about Â½ cup of the pasta cooking water before draining. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot."
10,"Pour the vodka sauce over the drained pasta in the pot. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly."
11,"Stir in the heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese. Toss again to combine. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash or two of the reserved pasta water to thin it out to your desired consistency."
12,"Season with additional salt and pepper to taste (if needed)."
13,"Optional: Stir in the crushed red pepper flakes for a touch of heat (adjust the amount to your preference)."
14,"Serve the Penne alla Vodka immediately, garnished with fresh chopped basil (optional) and additional Parmesan cheese for those who like it!"
15,"Enjoy this creamy and flavorful vodka pasta dish!"
