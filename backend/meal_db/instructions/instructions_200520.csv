Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the ingredients: Drain the soft tofu and break it up gently into bite-sized pieces. Mince the garlic, dice the onion, and slice the scallions (green and white parts). If using, slice the shiitake mushrooms and zucchini."
2,"Make the stock (optional): If not using store-bought anchovy kelp stock (kombu dashi), you can make your own by simmering a piece of kombu seaweed in water for 20-30 minutes. Strain the kombu out before using the stock."
3,"Heat the oil: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the neutral oil over medium heat."
4,"Saut√© the aromatics (optional): If using meat (pork belly), add it to the pot and cook until browned. Remove the cooked pork belly from the pot and set aside on a plate lined with paper towels. Add the diced onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened."
5,"Add the gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and gochujang (Korean chili paste): Stir in the gochugaru and cook for another minute, stirring constantly, to release the fragrance of the chili flakes."
6,"Deglaze the pan (optional): Add a splash of water or broth to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
7,"Add the broth and seasonings: Pour in the prepared anchovy kelp stock (or water) and Korean soybean paste (doenjang) (optional). Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer."
8,"Add vegetables and simmer: If using, add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and zucchini to the simmering broth. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly softened."
9,"Incorporate the tofu and cook briefly: Gently stir in the broken-up soft tofu. Be careful not to break it up too much. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes, or until the tofu is heated through."
10,"Season and adjust consistency: Add the minced garlic and chopped scallions (white parts only) to the pot. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If the stew seems too thin, you can simmer it for a few minutes longer to allow it to thicken slightly."
11,"Optional additions: If using, stir in the cooked and drained pork belly (or other protein) and cooked shrimp back to the pot. You can also crack an egg into the simmering stew and gently stir it in to create a poached egg effect."
12,"Finish and serve: Once heated through, remove the pot from the heat. Stir in a drizzle of sesame oil for extra flavor (optional). Taste and adjust seasonings with additional gochugaru, gochujang, or salt if desired."
13,"Serve hot: Ladle the sundubu jjigae into bowls and garnish with the remaining chopped scallion greens (optional). Serve hot with steamed rice and kimchi for a complete Korean meal. Enjoy!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the amount of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and gochujang (Korean chili paste) depending on your desired level of spiciness."
2,"Feel free to add other vegetables like green beans or carrots."
3,"The egg is optional but adds a nice richness to the stew."
