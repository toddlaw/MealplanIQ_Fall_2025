1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
2,"Combine the butter and white sugar in a mixing bowl until creamy. Incorporate 1 cup of flour and stir until a smooth dough forms. Distribute the mixture evenly into the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin, pressing it into the bottom and along the sides of each cup."
3,"To prepare the filling, combine the slivered almonds, brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan. Incorporate the cream and 2 teaspoons of flour. Continuously cook and stir the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a boil, which should take about 10 minutes. Evenly distribute the mixture among the prepared tart shells."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven until the tops and edges of the crust are lightly browned, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Take them out of the oven and allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before transferring the tarts from the muffin pan. Let them cool completely on a wire rack."
