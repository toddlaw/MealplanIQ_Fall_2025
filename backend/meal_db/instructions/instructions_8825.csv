7,"Chef John's Notes:"
8,"<strong>� </strong>The best results come from using high-quality cream, ideally obtained from grass-fed cows with a fat content between 36% and 40%. Steer clear of any cream labeled ""ultra-pasteurized,"" as it undergoes heat treatment that can affect the outcome.<br/><strong>� </strong>Most contemporary ovens have a minimum setting of around 175 to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), which is perfect for this method. A temperature of 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) can also work, but check the mixture after 10 hours to monitor its progress."
