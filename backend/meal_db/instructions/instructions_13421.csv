Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare baking sheets by lining them with waxed paper or parchment paper, and dusting with flour."
2,Combine the given dry ingredients in a bowl then blend in butter. Gradually incorporate hot milk until a stiff dough forms.
3,"Knead the dough on an oiled surface until cool and smooth, about 5 minutes. Divide into 32 equal-sized pieces and let rest for about 20 minutes, covered with a cloth."
4,"Roll out each piece of dough on a floured surface to form an 8-inch circle. Transfer the circles to the lined baking sheets, cover with a cloth, and let them rest for 30 minutes."
5,"Cut shapes out of the dough by folding each circle in half, then in half again, and snipping and cutting with a sharp knife or small cookie cutters the way you make a paper snowflake. Carefully unfold the dough to reveal the pattern. Stack the cut snowflakes between sheets of waxed paper on a flat surface."
6,Heat oil in a deep skillet until it reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be approximately 2 inches deep.
7,"Fry each snowflake in the hot oil, maintaining a flat position, until it turns golden brown and crispy, approximately 1 minute per side. Use tongs to carefully flip the snowflakes to prevent them from breaking. Place the fried snowflakes on paper towels to drain, then dust them with confectioners' sugar."
8,"You can increase the recipe by doubling or tripling, and store the snowflake cookies in an airtight container or freeze them until you are ready to enjoy them. Dust with powdered sugar just before serving."
9,"The information provided is estimated since the actual nutritional value may vary based on various factors such as cooking temperature and time, type of oil used, and ingredient density."
