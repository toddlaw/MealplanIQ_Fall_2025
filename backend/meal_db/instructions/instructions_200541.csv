1,"In a medium bowl, combine olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Whisk to create a marinade."
2,"Add the shrimp to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for deeper flavor."
3,"Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat (around 375°F). If using a grill pan, lightly oil the ridges."
4,"While the pan heats, remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the marinade."
5,"Sauté the sliced bell peppers and red onion in the hot pan for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and slightly charred."
6,"Remove the vegetables from the pan and set them aside on a plate."
7,"Increase the heat to high. Add the shrimp to the hot pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until pink and opaque. Shrimp cooks quickly, so avoid overcooking."
8,"Once cooked, remove the shrimp from the pan and toss them with the cooked vegetables."
9,"Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave for a few seconds until softened and pliable."
10,"To assemble the fajitas, spread some warmed tortillas with your desired toppings (cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cilantro). Add a portion of seasoned shrimp and vegetables. Roll up the tortillas and enjoy! Serve with lime wedges for an extra squeeze of fresh citrus flavor."
