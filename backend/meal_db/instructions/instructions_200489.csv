2,"Slice the onion: Thinly slice the onion."
3,"Make the sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, dashi stock, sugar, and sake (if using). Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir to dissolve the sugar."
4,"Cook the onions: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes."
5,"Add the beef: Add the sliced beef to the pan with the onions. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and cooked through."
6,"Simmer with sauce: Pour the prepared sauce from the saucepan into the pan with the beef and onions. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1-2 minutes to let the flavors meld."
7,"Serve: Divide the cooked white rice evenly between two bowls. Top each bowl with the gyudon beef and onion mixture, spooning over the flavorful sauce. Optionally garnish with pickled ginger (beni shoga), sliced scallions, and sesame seeds."
