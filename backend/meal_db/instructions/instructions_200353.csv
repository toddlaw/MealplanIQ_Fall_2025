1,"Preheat your oven to 375Â°F."
2,"Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to create two thin cutlets. Season both sides of the chicken cutlets with salt and black pepper."
3,"In three separate shallow dishes, place the all-purpose flour in one, beaten eggs in another, and a mixture of breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, and dried basil in the third."
4,"Dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off, and then coat it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere."
5,"In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the breaded chicken cutlets to the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the cooked chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil."
6,"Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the cooked chicken cutlets over the sauce."
7,"Top each chicken cutlet with additional marinara sauce, followed by shredded mozzarella cheese."
8,"Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly."
9,"Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving."
10,"Serve the chicken parmesan hot over cooked spaghetti or pasta, if desired."
