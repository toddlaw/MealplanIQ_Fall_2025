1,"Heat a large skillet or electric griddle, lightly greasing it."
2,"Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Add egg, buttermilk, and melted butter, stirring together until just combined, leaving the batter lumpy. The consistency should be thick, spongy, and puffy."
3,"Cook the batter by dropping 1/3 cup onto the cooking surface, spreading it lightly with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly browned on each side, about 1 to 2 minutes per side."
