1,"Preheat Oven: Preheat oven to 300Â°F."

4,"Whisk Egg Yolks and Sugar: In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until pale and thickened."
5,"Temper Eggs: Temper egg yolks by slowly whisking in a small amount of the hot cream mixture. Gradually whisk in the remaining cream mixture until fully incorporated."
6,"Add Vanilla: Stir in vanilla extract and salt."
7,"Strain Mixture: Strain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove any lumps."
8,"Divide into Ramekins: Divide the custard mixture evenly among six oven-safe ramekins."
