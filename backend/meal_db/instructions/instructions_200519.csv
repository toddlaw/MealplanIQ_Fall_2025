Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the pork belly: Pat the skin of the pork belly dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, score the skin in a diamond pattern without cutting into the meat. This helps the fat render during cooking."
2,"Bring water to a boil: In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the pork belly to a boil over high heat."
3,"Add aromatics and seasonings: Add the whole scallions, quartered onion, garlic cloves, black peppercorns, and bay leaves to the boiling water."
4,"Add the pork belly: Carefully lower the pork belly into the pot, skin side down. If the water doesn't cover the pork completely, add more water just to reach the top of the meat."
5,"Simmer the pork belly: Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours. You can also add Korean doenjang (soybean paste) and instant coffee (or brewed coffee) at this point for additional flavor (optional).
6,"Check for tenderness: After simmering for 1-1.5 hours, use tongs to gently prod the thickest part of the pork belly. If a chopstick can easily pierce through the meat, it's cooked through. If not, simmer for another 15-20 minutes or until tender."
7,"Cool the pork belly: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the pork belly cool completely in the cooking liquid for at least 1-2 hours. This helps the meat retain moisture and become more flavorful."
8,"Prepare the dipping sauce (optional): In a small bowl, combine the desired amount of gochujang, doenjang, sesame oil, rice vinegar, minced garlic, and chopped scallions to create a dipping sauce. Adjust the ingredients to your taste preference."
9,"Prepare the servings (optional): If using, prepare kimchi, pickled vegetables, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the bossam."
10,"Slice and serve: Once cooled, remove the pork belly from the pot and transfer it to a cutting board. Pat the skin dry with paper towels. Slice the pork belly thinly against the grain. Arrange the sliced pork belly on a serving plate."
11,"Serve with accompaniments (optional): Serve the sliced bossam with the prepared dipping sauce, kimchi, pickled vegetables, and lettuce leaves for wrapping. Enjoy!
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of the pork belly."
