Step,Instruction
1,Reheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2,"Add approximately 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips to each of four 6-ounce ramekins. Microwave them, heating in 30-second intervals on full power. Stir and keep heating until the chocolate has melted. Spread it to coat the sides and bottom of each ramekin."
3,Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.
4,"Meanwhile, in a saucepan, whisk together the cream, 1/4 cup of sugar, and salt. Heat over medium until steam rises from the surface. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and vanilla. Once the cream is hot, slowly ladle a small amount into the egg yolks while whisking rapidly. Gradually add more to raise the yolks' temperature without scrambling them. Whisk the yolk mixture back into the remaining cream. Ladle into the ramekins lined with chocolate."
5,"Put a towel at the bottom of a baking dish and arrange the filled ramekins on top of it. Transfer to the oven and carefully pour boiling water into the baking dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Loosely cover the dish with aluminum foil."
6,"Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, just until the custard sets. Take the ramekins out of the dish and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours."
7,"Before serving, add 1 tablespoon of sugar on top of each creme brulee. Use a kitchen torch or the broiler in your oven to caramelize the sugar, which may take about 2 to 3 minutes under the broiler. Serve immediately."
