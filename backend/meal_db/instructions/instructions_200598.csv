Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Eggs"
1,"Prepare the Poached Eggs: Bring a large pot of water to a simmer (around 190°F). You can add a splash of vinegar to the water to help the eggs hold their shape (optional)."
2,"Crack each egg into a small separate bowl."
3,"Optional Step (For Poached Eggs with a Rounder Shape): Create a small whirlpool in the simmering water using a spoon. Gently slip each egg into the center of the whirlpool."
4,"Cook the Poached Eggs: Poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and drain any excess water."
B,"Prepare the Salad"
5,"Wash and dry the mixed greens. Arrange them in a large serving bowl."
6,"Optional Step (For Crispy Bacon): In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the diced bacon lardons until crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Reserve the bacon fat in the pan."
7,"Optional Step (For Toasted Croutons): If using, add the croutons to the pan with the remaining bacon fat and cook over medium heat until lightly toasted. Remove the croutons from the pan and set aside."
8,"Sauté the Shallots (Optional, for Extra Flavor): In the same pan with the remaining bacon fat (or add a drizzle of olive oil if needed), sauté the thinly sliced shallots for 2-3 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
9,"Prepare the Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired."
C,"Assemble the Salade Lyonnaise"
10,"Arrange the cooked bacon lardons, shallots (if used), and croutons (if using) over the bed of mixed greens."
11,"Carefully place a poached egg on top of each salad."
12,"Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad just before serving. Gently toss to coat all ingredients."
13,"Garnish with chopped fresh chives (optional) and serve immediately.** Enjoy the Salade Lyonnaise as a delicious and satisfying main course salad!"
