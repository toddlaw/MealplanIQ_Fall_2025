1,"In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt using a whisk. Incorporate the shortening by cutting it in with a fork, pastry blender, or by rubbing it between your fingers. Create a well in the center and add the corn syrup and buttermilk. Use a sturdy spoon to mix until a soft dough forms. Split the dough in half and shape each half into circles about 3/4 inch thick on a floured surface. Slice each circle into 6 wedges."
2,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan."
