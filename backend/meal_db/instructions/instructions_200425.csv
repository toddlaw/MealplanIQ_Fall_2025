1,"Marinate the Beef: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine (or sherry), and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Prepare the Vegetables (Optional): Wash and cut the broccoli florets and red bell pepper (optional) into bite-sized pieces for stir-frying."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Sear the Beef: Add the marinated beef to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through (depending on the desired level of doneness)."
5,"Remove the Beef: Once cooked, transfer the seared beef to a plate and set aside."
6,"Stir-fry the Vegetables (Optional): If using, add an additional 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the broccoli florets and red bell pepper (optional) and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened and bright green (for broccoli)."
7,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, and white pepper. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce to your preference for saltiness and umami flavor."
8,"Add the Sauce: Pour the prepared sauce into the wok with the vegetables (or directly into the pan if not using vegetables)."
9,"Return the Beef: Add the cooked beef back to the wok with the sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the beef in the sauce."
10,"Simmer for a Minute: Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for an additional minute, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the beef."
11,"Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in a few drops of water (optional) to adjust the consistency of the sauce if needed. Garnish with chopped scallions and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious stir-fried beef with oyster sauce!"
