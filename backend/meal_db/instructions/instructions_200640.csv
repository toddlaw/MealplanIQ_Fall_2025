1,"Rinse rice in a fine-mesh strainer until water runs clear."

5,"Let rice cool slightly until it's comfortable to handle (around 100Â°F)."
6,"Prepare a small bowl of water and have a sheet of plastic wrap or nori seaweed nearby."

9,"Enclose the filling with remaining rice and shape the ball into a triangle or your desired form."
