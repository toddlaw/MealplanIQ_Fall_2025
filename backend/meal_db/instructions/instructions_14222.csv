1,Heat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and prepare four 9-inch round cake pans by greasing and flouring them.
2,"Combine raisins, coconut, and pecans with 1 cup of flour in a medium bowl, ensuring all ingredients are evenly coated. Set the mixture aside."
3,"Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together remaining flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture in batches, alternating with milk. Gently fold in the raisin mixture until fully combined."
4,"Fold whipped egg whites into the batter until evenly combined, and then distribute the mixture among the greased and floured cake pans."
5,"Bake in the oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, approximately 30 minutes. Let cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks to finish cooling."
6,"Cook sugar and flour in a saucepan with water over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Chop oranges and lemons into small pieces, add to the saucepan, and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook until thick, about 10 minutes. Stir in coconut and let it cool."
7,"Layer the cake with the prepared filling in between the cooled cake layers, and finish by topping with the filling."
