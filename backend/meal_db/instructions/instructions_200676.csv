1,"Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.** You can use butter or cooking spray for greasing the pan."
2,"Combine the Corn Kernels, Milk, Eggs, Melted Butter, and Vanilla Extract in a blender. Blend until mostly smooth, with some small corn kernel pieces remaining for texture. Alternatively, you can use a food processor to achieve a similar consistency."
3,"In a large bowl, whisk together the Sugar, All-Purpose Flour, Baking Powder, and Salt."
4,"Pour the wet ingredients (blended corn mixture) from the blender into the dry ingredients (flour mixture) in the bowl.** Stir with a spatula until just combined. Do not overmix."
5,"Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.** Smooth the top with a spatula."
6,"Bake the Pan de Elote for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean."
7,"Let the cornbread cool slightly in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely."
8,"Optional Step: Once cool, dust the top of the Pan de Elote with powdered sugar for a touch of sweetness and visual appeal."
9,"Serve Mexican Cornbread (Pan de Elote) warm or at room temperature.** Enjoy it on its own as a snack or dessert, or pair it with savory dishes like chili or stews."
10,"Storage: Leftover Pan de Elote can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
