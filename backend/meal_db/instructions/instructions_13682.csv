1,"Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, egg, cream, salt, and allspice in a bowl, and mix thoroughly by hand until well combined. Shape the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs."
2,"Brown about half of the meatballs in the melted butter until they are evenly browned on all sides, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove them to a plate, and then repeat this process with the remaining meatballs. Make sure to keep the liquid in the skillet when all the meatballs are finished."
3,"Brown 1/3 cup flour in 3 tablespoons butter about 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually stir in 2 cups milk into the skillet, stirring constantly until thickened. Add 1 cup cream and mix well. Pour gravy over meatballs. Allow meatballs and gravy to simmer until fully cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes."
