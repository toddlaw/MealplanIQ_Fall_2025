1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9-inch fluted tube pan, like a Bundt, by greasing and flouring it."
2,"Combine flour, baking powder, ground ginger, cinnamon, and salt by sifting them together. Set aside."
3,"In a spacious bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar together until light and airy. Add the eggs one by one, then mix in the grated ginger and vanilla. Gradually incorporate the flour mixture and milk, mixing just until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out free of batter. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a serving plate. Lightly dust with confectioners' sugar before serving."
