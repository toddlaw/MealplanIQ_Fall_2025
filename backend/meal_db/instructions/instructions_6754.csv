1,"Combine the sazon seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic zipper bag, add the beer, and seal the bag. Gently massage the bag with your fingers for a few seconds to blend the beer with the seasonings, then add the chicken thighs to the marinade. Reseal the bag, removing as much air as you can, and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours or overnight."
2,"Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly coat the grate with oil."
3,"Take the chicken out of the marinade, while keeping the marinade aside. Grill the chicken until it's no longer pink in the center, the juices are clear, and there are nice grill markings, about 5 to 8 minutes on each side. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of a thigh should show at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
4,"Transfer the reserved marinade to a saucepan set over medium-high heat, bring it to a boil, and cook until the marinade reduces by half, approximately 10 minutes. Stir in the barbecue sauce and spread it generously over the chicken before serving."
5,"I used bone-in thighs, but you can definitely use boneless ones to save time."
