step,instruction
1,"Prepare the veal: Place the veal cutlets between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound the veal to an even thickness of about ¼ inch."
2,"Season the veal cutlets on both sides with salt and pepper to taste."
3,"Dredge the veal cutlets in the all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess."
4,"Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted and hot, carefully add the floured veal cutlets in a single layer (you may need to cook the veal in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan)."
5,"Cook the veal for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or the veal will steam instead of sear."
6,"Transfer the cooked veal to a plate and keep them warm in a preheated oven at 200°F (93°C) while you prepare the sauce."
7,"Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the pan. Once melted, swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the shallot (or onion) and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
8,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
9,"Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and golden brown. Stir occasionally to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
10,"Pour in the Marsala wine and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly reduced."
11,"Whisk in the chicken broth and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly."
12,"Optional: If the sauce seems too thin, you can simmer it for a few additional minutes to allow it to thicken slightly. Alternatively, you can whisk in a cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) to thicken the sauce."
13,"Return the cooked veal cutlets to the pan with the Marsala sauce. Spoon the sauce over the veal to coat them evenly."
14,"Optional: Add a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice (if using) to the pan for a brighter flavor. Heat through for an additional minute or two."
15,"Serve the Veal Marsala immediately, garnished with fresh parsley (optional)."
16,"Enjoy this classic and elegant Italian dish!"
