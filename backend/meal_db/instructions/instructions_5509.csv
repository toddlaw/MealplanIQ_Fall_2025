7,"""Cr�me br�l�e is one of those dishes that seems much more sophisticated than it really is,"" says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (also known as <a data-component=""link"" data-ordinal=""1"" data-source=""inlineLink"" data-type=""internalLink"" href=""https://www.allrecipes.com/author/nicole-mclaughlin/"">NicoleMcMom</a>). ""Essentially, we're just preparing a custard � you've got this."" Here are some of her top tips and tricks for making cr�me br�l�e:"
8,"<strong>� </strong>It�s essential to temper your egg yolks by gradually adding them to the cream. If you pour them directly into the hot cream, you�ll end up with scrambled eggs, according to Nicole.<br/><strong>� </strong>Remove the cr�me br�l�e from the oven while it's still a bit jiggly, similar to a cheesecake. It will firm up as it cools.<br/><strong>� </strong>You�ll know the cr�me br�l�e is perfectly ready to enjoy when you hear a distinct ""tap, tap, tap"" sound as you tap the hardened sugar with the back of your spoon."
9,"Definitely! You can prepare the cr�me br�l�e's custard base up to two days ahead�just cover each ramekin securely and keep in the refrigerator. When you're nearly ready to serve the dessert, sprinkle with the sugar mixture and broil until caramelized. Allow to chill for at least 10 minutes before serving."
