Step,Instruction
A,"For the Dough"
1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, active dry yeast, and sugar."
2,"In a separate bowl, combine the warm water and vegetable oil. Stir to combine."
3,"Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms. Add the salt and knead for 5-7 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic."
4,"Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size."
B,"For the Filling (choose one)"
C,"Pork Filling"
5,"In a medium bowl, combine the ground pork, chopped napa cabbage, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (or sherry), sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper. Mix well and set aside."
D,"Vegetable Filling"
6,"In a medium bowl, combine the shredded carrots, chopped green cabbage, chopped mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water). Mix well and set aside."
E,"Shaping the Buns"
7,"Once the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough to release the air. Divide the dough into 12-16 equal pieces."
8,"On a lightly floured surface, roll each dough piece into a circle about 3-4 inches in diameter. The dough should be thin in the center and slightly thicker around the edges."
9,"Place a spoonful of your chosen filling in the center of each dough circle."
10,"Pinch the dough edges together to enclose the filling, forming a bun shape. You can make pleats on the top for a decorative look (optional)."
F,"Steaming the Buns"
11,"Lightly grease a steamer basket with vegetable oil. Line the bottom of the steamer basket with parchment paper cut to fit (optional)."
12,"Arrange the shaped buns in the prepared steamer basket, leaving some space between them for expansion. Cover the steamer basket with a lid."
13,"Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Place the steamer basket over the boiling water and reduce the heat to medium-high. Steam the buns for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through. The buns should be fluffy and slightly springy to the touch."
14,"Optional: While the buns are steaming, you can sprinkle some sesame seeds or chopped scallions on top for an extra garnish (optional)."
15,"Carefully remove the steamer basket from the pot and let the buns cool slightly before serving."
16,"Tips: Make sure the water in the pot is simmering, not boiling vigorously, to prevent the buns from breaking open. You can also use a bamboo steamer for steaming the buns. Leftover steamed buns can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a steamer for a few minutes to refresh or microwave for a short time, but they may lose some of their fluffiness."
