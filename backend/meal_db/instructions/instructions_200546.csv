1,"Stem the dried chiles and remove most of the seeds. Be careful to avoid touching your eyes as the oils can irritate them. Wearing gloves is recommended."
2,"In a large pot, cover the dried chiles with boiling water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or until softened. You can soak them for up to an hour for a deeper chili flavor."
3,"While the chiles soak, heat a large Dutch oven or oven-proof pot over medium heat. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the hot pot and sear the chicken thighs on all sides until golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside."
4,"In the same pot (with the remaining oil and browned chicken drippings), add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
5,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, or until fragrant."
6,"Drain the soaked chiles, reserving about 1 cup of the soaking liquid. Transfer the softened chiles to a blender along with the chopped tomatoes, pepitas, almonds, sesame seeds, piloncillo cone (or brown sugar), and raisins. Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved soaking liquid and blend into a smooth sauce. You may need to blend in batches depending on your blender size."
7,"Pour the blended sauce back into the pot with the cooked onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld."
8,"Return the browned chicken thighs to the pot with the sauce. Add the remaining chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30-45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling off the bone."
9,"Once cooked, shred the chicken thighs with two forks and return the shredded chicken to the pot with the mole sauce. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to further marry."
10,"Serve the mole poblano hot over cooked white rice.  Offer a variety of garnishes on the side, such as sesame seeds, chopped fresh cilantro, sliced avocado, crema Mexicana or sour cream. Enjoy the complex flavors of this traditional Mexican dish!"
