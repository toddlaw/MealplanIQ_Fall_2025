1,"Start by preparing the marinade. In a large mixing bowl, combine the plain yogurt, lemon juice, minced garlic, grated ginger, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined."
2,"Add the chicken thighs to the bowl with the marinade, ensuring that they are well coated on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop and the chicken to marinate."
3,"Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, around 400°F."
4,"Remove the marinated chicken thighs from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 15-20 minutes."
5,"Brush the grill grates with vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Place the marinated chicken thighs on the grill and cook for 6-8 minutes per side, or until they are fully cooked through and have nice grill marks."
6,"While the chicken is cooking, you can baste it with any remaining marinade to keep it moist and flavorful."
7,"Once the chicken thighs are cooked through and have reached an internal temperature of 165°F, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes."
8,"Serve the chicken tandoori hot, garnished with fresh cilantro and lemon wedges. You can enjoy it with rice, naan bread, or your favorite side dishes. Enjoy the delicious flavors of this classic Indian dish!"
