Step,Instruction
1,Collect all the ingredients.
2,"Dissolve the yeast in warm water in a small bowl and let it sit until it becomes creamy, around 10 minutes."
3,"Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Create a well in the center and add the eggs and yeast mixture; mix thoroughly until a dough forms. (Tip: If necessary, incorporate 1 to 3 tablespoons of extra warm water, one tablespoon at a time, to assist in bringing the dough together.)"
4,"Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it until it becomes smooth and elastic, which should take around 8 minutes."
5,Flatten the dough and spread 1/3 of the butter over it.
6,Incorporate the butter into the dough by kneading.
7,"Repeat this process two more times to add the remaining butter, allowing the dough to rest for a few minutes between each butter addition, totaling about 20 minutes."
8,"Lightly coat a large bowl with vegetable oil, place the dough inside, and turn it to ensure it's coated. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a warm area until it has doubled in size, approximately 1 hour."
9,"Pound down the dough, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 6 hours to overnight."
10,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans lightly."
11,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Split the dough into two equal portions, shape into loaves, and place them in the prepared loaf pans."
12,"Cover with oiled plastic wrap and allow to rise until it has doubled in size, approximately 1 hour."
13,Make the egg wash by beating together the egg yolk and cold water in a small bowl. Brush the mixture over the tops of the loaves.
14,"Bake the loaves in the preheated oven until the tops achieve a deep golden brown color, approximately 25 minutes. Allow them to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before moving them to wire racks to cool completely."
15,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease your muffin tins or fluted brioche molds. Portion the dough according to the number of molds you have. Take one portion and remove a third of it so that you have two pieces. Roll both pieces into balls, placing the larger ball into the muffin tin or mold. Use two fingers to create a deep well in the center of the larger ball. Shape the smaller piece of dough into a ball and then roll it into an elongated oval. Gently insert the narrow end of the oval into the well of the larger ball, leaving only the top of the oval exposed. Continue this process with the remaining dough. Cover and allow the brioche to rise until it has reached the top of the pan. Brush the tops with egg wash. Bake in the preheated oven until they are deep golden brown, around 10 minutes."
16,"This recipe was tried out in our test kitchen in April 2023, and we revised it to specify two 8x4-inch loaf pans (instead of 9x5 inch) and included a suggestion to incorporate 1 to 3 tablespoons of extra warm water, if necessary, to assist in bringing the dough together."
