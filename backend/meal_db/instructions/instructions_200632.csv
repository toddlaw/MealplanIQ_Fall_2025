Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Eggplant"
1,"Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 400Â°F."
2,"Wash and Cut Eggplant: Wash and dry the eggplant. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, leaving the stem on (optional). Score a diamond pattern into the flesh of each eggplant half with a knife."
3,"Optional Broiling (for a smoky flavor): If desired, lightly brush the cut sides of the eggplant with neutral oil and broil them cut-side up for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly softened and browned."
4,"Bake the Eggplant: If not broiling, simply brush the cut sides of the eggplant with sesame oil and place them cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake the eggplant for 15-20 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork."
B,"Make the Miso Glaze"
5,"Combine Glaze Ingredients: In a small saucepan, whisk together the white miso paste, mirin, sugar, and sake (if using) until smooth. Heat the mixture over low heat until slightly warmed and thickened, stirring constantly."
C,"Glaze and Broil"
6,"Glaze the Eggplant: Once the eggplant is cooked, remove the pan from the oven and carefully flip the eggplant halves over. Brush the cut sides generously with the miso glaze."
7,"Broil for Caramelization: Return the eggplant to the oven and broil on high for 2-3 minutes, or until the miso glaze is bubbly and caramelized."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
8,"Garnish and Serve:  Transfer the glazed eggplant to serving plates.  Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and your choice of additional garnishes like shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice powder) and thinly sliced scallions (optional). Serve hot and enjoy!"
E,"Tips"
1,"You can adjust the amount of miso paste in the glaze to your preference for stronger or milder miso flavor."
2,"If the miso glaze thickens too much while broiling, add a teaspoon or two of water to thin it slightly."
3,"Leftover nasu dengaku can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them gently in a pan or oven until warmed through, but the miso glaze may lose some of its crispness."
