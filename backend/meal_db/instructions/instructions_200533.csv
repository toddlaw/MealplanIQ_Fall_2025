1,"Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering."
2,"Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (about 4 minutes)."
3,"Add bell pepper and mushrooms. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened."
4,"Stir in black beans, corn, and green chiles (if using). Heat through for 2-3 minutes."
5,"Add chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices."
6,"Pour in vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
7,"Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld. The mixture should thicken slightly."
8,"While the filling simmers, warm corn tortillas according to package instructions (microwave, stovetop, etc.). You can also wrap them in foil and heat in a warm oven (200°F) for 5-10 minutes."
9,"Prepare your desired fillings (cooked rice, quinoa, pico de gallo, etc.)."
10,"Assemble enchiladas by laying a warmed tortilla flat. Spread a generous portion of the veggie mixture down the center. Top with your desired fillings (rice, quinoa, salsa, etc.) and sprinkle with shredded cheese (if using)."
11,"Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up and over the filling. Then fold in the sides, like a business letter. Roll the enchilada tightly, starting from the bottom."
12,"Optional: You can wrap the enchilada in foil to keep it warm and secure the shape."
13,"Pour about 1 cup of enchilada sauce (enough to coat the bottom) into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange the rolled enchiladas seam side down in the baking dish."
14,"Pour any remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the enchiladas, ensuring they are mostly covered."
15,"Preheat oven to 350°F if not already preheated."
16,"Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the enchiladas are heated through."
17,"Let cool slightly before serving. Garnish with chopped cilantro, lime wedges, and your favorite toppings (sour cream, guacamole, salsa, etc.)."
