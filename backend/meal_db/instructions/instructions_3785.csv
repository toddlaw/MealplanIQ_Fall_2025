1,"Preheat the oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with wax paper."
2,"Combine flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl; incorporate butter and tahini until the dough becomes crumbly. Shape the dough into small balls and flatten each one into a cookie shape using your palms. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet and press them with a fork."
3,"Place the baking sheet on the center rack of the oven and bake until the cookies are golden brown, approximately 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely."
4,"Eggs are not included in the traditional recipe for religious dietary reasons, but you can add them if you wish. One egg will help the cookies hold together better when warm, while two eggs will provide more structure and texture."
5,"Honey or brown sugar can be substituted for white sugar."
6,"Nuts, dried fruits, or vanilla extract can also be included in the batter."
7,"It is crucial to allow the cookies to cool completely, as they are quite delicate right after being removed from the oven."
