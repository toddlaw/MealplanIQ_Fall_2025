1,"Mix 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water in a medium-sized saucepan over high heat. Stir it until the sugar is fully dissolved after it reaches a boil. Lower the heat to medium and stir in the lime juice. Allow it to simmer for nearly 10 minutes for the flavors to meld. Take it off the heat and add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, then set aside to let the syrup cool down."
2,"Mix vegetable oil, the remaining 2 cups of water, the remaining 1 cup of sugar, and salt in a sizable pot over medium-high heat; bring it to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, then drop in the flour all at once, stirring energetically with a wooden spoon until a ball of dough forms. Keep cooking until the dough develops a glossy appearance, which should take about 1 minute. Shift the dough to a broad bowl and let it sit for approximately 5 minutes."
3,"Press the batter to the bottom of the bowl. Incorporate the eggs one by one, ensuring each is well combined before adding the next. Mix in the remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla to achieve a creamy batter. Transfer the mixture into a fabric piping bag equipped with a broad star nozzle."
4,"Heat the corn oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Squeeze a 2-inch segment of the batter on an oiled spatula and slowly lower it into the hot oil. Continue this process until the saucepan is filled. Allow the pastries to cook while occasionally turning them until they turn golden brown, typically taking around 5 minutes. Afterwards, transfer the pastries onto a paper bag allowing them to drain for approximately 30 seconds."
5,"Dunk the warm pastries in the syrup and then move them to a plate to chill for around 5 minutes."
