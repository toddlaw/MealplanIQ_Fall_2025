Step,Instruction
1,"Wash and peel the Korean radish (daikon). Cut the radish into thin julienne strips or matchsticks. You can use a julienne peeler or mandoline for easier and more uniform cutting."
2,"Place the julienned radish in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Toss well to coat evenly. Set aside for 15-20 minutes to allow the salt to draw out excess moisture from the radish."
3,"Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Mince the garlic and thinly slice the scallions."
4,"After 15-20 minutes, the radish should have released some liquid. Drain the liquid in a colander, rinsing the radish briefly under cold running water to remove some of the salt. Squeeze out any excess moisture with your hands or a clean kitchen towel."
5,"Transfer the drained radish back to the large bowl."
6,"Add minced garlic, sliced scallions, and sugar (if using) to the bowl."
7,"In a small bowl, whisk together gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), fish sauce, rice vinegar (or white vinegar, if using), and sesame oil (if using). Adjust the amount of gochugaru depending on your desired spice level."
8,"Pour the prepared sauce over the radish and toss gently to ensure all the radish pieces are evenly coated."
9,"Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You can add a pinch more sugar for additional sweetness or a touch more fish sauce for a stronger savory flavor."
10,"Garnish with sesame seeds and serve Mu Saengchae immediately at room temperature or slightly chilled as a side dish with Korean meals."
