Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9-inch square baking dish by greasing and flouring it."
2,"In a medium bowl, combine the flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Cut the shortening into very small pieces, then incorporate the milk and egg using an electric mixer on low speed. Mix for about 1 minute, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl at least once to prevent lumps. Gently fold in the walnuts by hand. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and spread it out evenly."
3,"Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for about 30 minutes while you prepare the honey syrup."
4,"Cool the honey syrup to room temperature. Once the cake has cooled in the pan, remove it and place it on a serving plate. Drizzle the honey syrup over the cake while it's still warm so it absorbs the sweetness."
5,"Allow the syrup to soak in for about 30 minutes before serving."
