1,"In South Africa, what we call pancakes differs greatly from the American version. Ours are very thin and around 25 cm (10 inches) in diameter, much like French crepes. If you wish, you can opt for lemon juice instead of the vinegar."
2,"In a food processor or blender, blend the cooked beet, flour, milk, egg, vegetable oil, and vinegar until the mixture is smooth."
3,"Transfer the batter into a bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes."
4,"Mix the cinnamon with the sugar thoroughly."
5,"Warm a non-stick pan greased with a bit of oil over medium heat."
6,"Add sufficient batter to half-fill the skillet. By tipping and rotating the skillet, ensure the batter spreads evenly across the whole surface."
7,"Allow it to cook until it transitions from wet to moist and the edges start to lift from the pan's sides."
8,"Flip the pancake and let it cook until it attains a light golden hue on the other side. Place the cooked pancake on a plate and cover with a kitchen cloth to maintain moisture."
9,"Repeat this process with the rest of the batter, remembering to grease the skillet lightly each time to prevent sticking of the pancakes."
10,"Evenly distribute the cinnamon sugar over the pancakes. Roll the pancakes into logs and serve accompanied with quartered oranges."
