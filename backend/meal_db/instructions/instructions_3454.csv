1,"Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Brown the ground beef until fully cooked, about 7 to 10 minutes. Move the cooked ground beef to a plate to drain, while keeping the remaining oil in the pan."
2,"Return the skillet to medium heat with the leftover oil. Add onion, garlic, and curry powder; cook and stir until the onion is nearly tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Mix the cooked ground beef and cabbage into the onion mixture; then stir in ketchup, chutney, and salt. Add a splash of water to avoid burning, but be careful not to make the curry too wet."
