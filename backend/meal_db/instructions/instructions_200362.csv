1,"Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips, about 1/2 inch wide."
2,"In a mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, curry powder, minced garlic, grated ginger, and salt. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the marinade is well combined."
3,"Place the chicken strips in the marinade, making sure they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results."
4,"Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, about 375Â°F."
5,"While the grill is heating, soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent them from burning."
6,"Thread the marinated chicken strips onto the soaked skewers, leaving a little space between each piece."
7,"Once the grill is hot, lightly oil the grates to prevent sticking. Place the chicken skewers on the grill and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks."
8,"Remove the chicken satay from the grill and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as peanut sauce or sweet chili sauce. Enjoy!"
