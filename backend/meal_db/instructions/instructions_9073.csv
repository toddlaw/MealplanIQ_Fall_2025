1,"Combine molasses, cream, sugar, and cocoa powder in a pot and bring to a boil. Heat the mixture to 251 degrees F (122 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water creates a firm yet pliable ball, approximately 30 to 40 minutes. The final candy will have the same firmness as the ball in water. Take the pot off the heat and mix in the almonds and vanilla extract."
2,"Scoop the candy into small paper candy cups. Allow to cool to room temperature and store in an airtight container at room temperature."
