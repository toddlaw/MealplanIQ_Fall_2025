1,"Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
2,"In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork (if using), breadcrumbs, milk, chopped onion, egg, ketchup, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to gently mix all ingredients until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can make the meatloaf dense."
3,"Shape the meatloaf mixture into a loaf form on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Gently press the top of the meatloaf to create a smooth surface."
4,"Bake the meatloaf in the preheated oven for 1 hour. For an optional glaze, in a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon ketchup and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Brush the glaze over the top of the meatloaf during the last 15 minutes of baking."
5,"An internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) in the thickest part of the meatloaf is ideal for a safe and cooked-through result. Use a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf to check for doneness."
6,"Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat for a more flavorful and tender meatloaf."
7,"Serve your delicious homemade meatloaf with your favorite sides like mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or gravy. Enjoy!
