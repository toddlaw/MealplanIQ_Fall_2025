1,"Peel and slice the Vidalia onion into 1/2-inch thick rings. Separate the rings and gently pull them apart to form individual rings."
2,"In a shallow bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, seasoned salt, paprika, and garlic powder."
3,"In a separate bowl or shallow dish, pour the cold beer."
4,"In another shallow dish or bowl, spread out the panko breadcrumbs."
5,"Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350Â°F. You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of breadcrumb in the oil - it should sizzle and turn golden brown within seconds."
6,"Dredge each onion ring in the flour mixture, coating them evenly. Shake off any excess flour."
7,"Dip the floured onion ring into the cold beer, coating completely."
8,"Finally, dredge the beer-coated onion ring in the panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure good adhesion."
9,"Fry the onion rings in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
10,"Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried onion rings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
11,"Season the fried onion rings with additional seasoned salt (optional) while still hot."
12,"Serve the onion rings hot with your favorite dipping sauce, like ketchup, ranch dressing, or aioli."
