Step,Instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat."
2,"Optional: If using fresh herbs or garlic powder, add them to the boiling water."
3,"While the water heats, remove the husks and silks from the corn cobs. You can use a stiff brush or your thumb to remove the silks."
4,"Once the water is boiling, add the corn cobs. You may need to cut the cobs in half to fit them comfortably in the pot."
5,"Reduce heat to medium-high and cook the corn for 3-5 minutes, or until the kernels are bright yellow and tender. You can test for doneness by piercing a kernel with a knife - it should easily slide through."
6,"While the corn is cooking, melt the butter in a small bowl. Stir in salt and black pepper (and lemon juice if using) to create a flavored butter."
7,"Drain the corn cobs and immediately brush them with the flavored butter."
8,"Serve hot. Enjoy the corn on the cob on its own or with additional toppings like grated parmesan cheese or chili flakes."
