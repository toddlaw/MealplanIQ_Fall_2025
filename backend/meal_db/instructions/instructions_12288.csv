1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until just tender, then drain and set aside."
2,"While the pasta is boiling, warm a skillet over medium heat. Combine olive oil, butter, and liquid from artichoke hearts in the skillet. Cut artichoke hearts into bite-sized pieces. Once the oil mixture is hot, add onion and garlic, and sauté until soft and lightly browned. Add the artichoke hearts and cook until warmed through. Season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and oregano. Remove from heat, mix in cottage cheese and sour cream. Combine with cooked pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving."
