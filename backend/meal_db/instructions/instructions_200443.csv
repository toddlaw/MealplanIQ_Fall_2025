1,"Pat the chicken dry and season generously with salt and pepper."
2,"Cut the bacon into lardons (thin strips)."
3,"In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sear the chicken on all sides until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside."
4,"Add the bacon to the pot and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pot with a slotted spoon and set aside."
5,"Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the shallots and garlic to the pot. Cook until softened, about 3 minutes."
6,"Add the pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot and cook until softened and starting to brown, about 10 minutes."
7,"Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute."
8,"Pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 5 minutes."
9,"Add the beef broth, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaves to the pot. Bring to a simmer and return the chicken to the pot. Nestle the bacon back on top."
10,"Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender."
11,"While the chicken is simmering, prepare the French bread by toasting it in the oven or toaster."
12,"Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and transfer it to a plate. Strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan, discarding the solids."
13,"Bring the cooking liquid to a simmer over medium heat. Let it simmer until it has reduced by about half, about 10-15 minutes. This will thicken the sauce."
14,"In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in a little bit of the pan sauce until a smooth roux forms."
15,"Whisk the roux back into the pan sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste."
16,"Return the chicken to the pot and spoon the sauce over it. Serve immediately with toasted French bread."
