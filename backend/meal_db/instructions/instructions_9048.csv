1,"Put bacon in a large skillet and fry over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned evenly, approximately 10 minutes. Drain the cooked bacon on paper towels and crumble it. Keep 1 tablespoon of bacon grease in the skillet."
2,"Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet with bacon grease and cook over high heat until the chicken is golden brown all over, approximately 10 minutes. Move the chicken to a plate."
3,"Cook and stir the onions in the same skillet until they become soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Lower the heat and mix in the paprika and caraway seeds with the onions; then add the chicken. Cover the skillet and cook for 30 minutes. Add the potatoes to the chicken mixture, cover the skillet again, and cook until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, which should take about another 30 minutes. Move the chicken and potatoes to a serving dish."
4,"Gently mix sour cream, parsley, and garlic powder into the same skillet until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy, taking about 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle the sauce over the chicken and potatoes, then top with crumbled bacon."
