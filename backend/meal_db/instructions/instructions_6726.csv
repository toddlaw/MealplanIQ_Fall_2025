1,"Combine rice and water in a saucepan, then bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and let it simmer for 20 minutes."
2,"At the same time, add the chicken breast halves to a large saucepan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, or until fully cooked. Take the chicken out of the water. Once it has cooled enough to handle, cut the meat into bite-sized pieces."

Arrange 1/2 of the rice, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in the prepared dish. Repeat the layers, finishing with the cheese on top."
