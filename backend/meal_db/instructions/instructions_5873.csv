1,"In the same skillet, melt the remaining butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes without browning. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in the cheese until melted and smooth."
2,"In the same skillet, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil. Place one tortilla in the skillet; layer with 1/4 cup of cheese, half of the onion mixture, and another 1/4 cup of cheese. Add a second tortilla on top and cook the quesadilla until it is browned and the cheese has melted, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, add more oil to the skillet, and continue the process with the remaining quesadilla."
