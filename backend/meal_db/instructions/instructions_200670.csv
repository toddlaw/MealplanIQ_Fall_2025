1,"Cooking the Tortillas: You can use store-bought tostada shells or make your own crispy tortillas. Here are two methods:"
1a,"Frying: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat (350°F). Carefully fry the tortillas one at a time for about 30-60 seconds per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain the fried tortillas on paper towels to remove excess oil."
1b,"Baking: Preheat your oven to 400°F. Lightly brush both sides of the tortillas with vegetable oil. Arrange the tortillas on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 5-7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
2,"Spread a layer of refried beans on each tostada shell. You can use a spoon or spatula to evenly coat the surface."
3,"Top with your desired protein (optional): Shredded cooked chicken, beef, ground beef, or black beans are all popular choices."
4,"Layer on your favorite toppings (optional): Chopped lettuce, diced tomato, sliced avocado, chopped onion, sour cream, salsa, guacamole, cilantro, etc. Get creative and customize your tostadas!"
5,"Serve immediately while the tostada shells are crispy. Enjoy with lime wedges for squeezing extra citrus juice over your creation."
