Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Dashi (Broth)"
1. "Soak the Kombu (Optional): If using kombu, wipe it clean with a damp cloth.  Place the kombu in a pot with the water. Cover and let it soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight for a stronger flavor."
2. "Bring to a Simmer (Optional):  Once soaked, bring the water with kombu to a simmer over medium heat. **Do not boil!**  A gentle simmer is key to prevent a tough and bitter flavor in the kombu."
3. "Remove Kombu (Optional):  Once the water simmers, remove the kombu from the pot and discard it. **Optional:** If using dried shiitake mushrooms, add them to the pot at this point and simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes for extra flavor.  Then remove and discard the mushrooms, or slice them and add them back to the soup later."
B,"Add Miso Paste"
4. "Reduce Heat: Reduce the heat to low. **Important:** Miso paste loses some of its beneficial properties when boiled.  We want to add it after reducing the heat."
5. "Whisk in Miso Paste: In a small bowl, whisk a few tablespoons of hot broth with the miso paste until smooth. This helps prevent the miso paste from clumping when added to the pot."
6. "Gradually Add Miso: Slowly whisk the miso mixture back into the pot with the remaining broth.  Taste and adjust the amount of miso paste to your preference for flavor and intensity."
C,"Add Vegetables and Tofu (Optional)"
7. "Bring to a Simmer (Optional) If using vegetables and tofu, add them to the pot and bring the soup to a gentle simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender-crisp and the tofu is heated through."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
8,"Serve Hot:  Turn off the heat and ladle the miso soup into bowls. Garnish with additional sliced green onions or sesame seeds (optional). Serve hot and enjoy!**"
