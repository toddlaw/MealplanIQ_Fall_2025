1,"Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper."
2,"Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once hot, sear the chicken pieces on all sides until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside."
3,"Add the chopped onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper to the pot. Saut√© for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and starting to brown."
4,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
5,"Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to incorporate it with the vegetables."

8,"Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. The juices should run clear when the thickest part of the chicken is pierced with a fork."
