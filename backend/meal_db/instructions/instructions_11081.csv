Step,Instruction
1,"Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Heat the mixture until it reaches between 223 and 234 degrees F (106 to 112 degrees C), or until a small amount forms a soft thread when dripped from a spoon, about 1 to 2 minutes."
2,"Once the sugar mixture reaches the thread stage, take it off the heat. Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Slowly pour in the sugar syrup while mixing at medium speed. Continue whipping for 10 minutes to cool the mixture, creating fluffy, glossy egg whites."
3,"Incorporate cold butter pieces one at a time into the egg whites while continuing to mix at medium or low speed. Repeat this process with the shortening. The mixture may appear curdled initially, but keep mixing for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth again. Add the vanilla extract. Store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
4,"To use after refrigeration, let it reach room temperature, then mix with a mixer before use. If cold, heat over a double boiler until liquid is visible around the edges. Beat with a mixer until smooth and fluffy before using."
