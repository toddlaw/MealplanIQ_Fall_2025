1,"Prepare the Potatoes: Wash, peel, and cut the potatoes into bite-sized cubes. You can cut them into cubes, wedges, or even small batons."
2,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 325°F (165°C). You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of potato in the oil - it should sizzle and start to float within seconds."
3,"Fry the potatoes in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain the potatoes on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil."
4,**Optional:** If using red bell pepper, add it to the hot oil after removing the potatoes and cook until softened, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside with the potatoes.
5,**Prepare the Sauce:** While the potatoes are frying, heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the dried red chili peppers and Szechuan peppercorns. Toast them for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant (be careful not to burn them). Remove from the pan and grind them together in a mortar and pestle (or crush with a spoon) to a coarse powder.
6,"Add the garlic, ginger, and chopped scallions to the wok or skillet. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
7,"In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, and water. Pour the sauce mixture into the wok or skillet and bring to a simmer."
8,"Add the ground chili pepper and Szechuan peppercorn mixture back to the sauce. Simmer for an additional minute, allowing the flavors to meld."
9,"Return the fried potatoes (and red bell pepper, if using) to the wok or skillet. Toss to coat them in the sauce."
10,"Stir in the roasted peanuts and sesame oil. Cook for another minute or two, until heated through."
11,"Season the kung pao potatoes with salt to taste."
12,"Serve the kung pao potatoes hot over rice. You can garnish with additional chopped scallions (optional)."
13,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 4-6 servings. You can adjust the amount of chili peppers and Szechuan peppercorns to your desired level of spice. Leftover kung pao potatoes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or microwave until warmed through, but the potatoes may lose some crispness."
