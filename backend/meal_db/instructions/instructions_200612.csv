Step,Instruction
1,"Toast the Saffron: In a small heat-resistant bowl, combine the saffron threads with 1 tablespoon of hot water. Let it steep for at least 10 minutes, allowing the saffron to infuse its flavor."
2,"Heat the Broth: In a saucepan, heat the chicken broth over medium heat until simmering. Keep it warm over low heat."
3,"Saut√© the Onion: In a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
4,"Toast the Rice: Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat it with the butter. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, to toast the rice slightly."
5,"Deglaze with Wine: Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is almost completely absorbed."
6,"Begin Adding Broth: Gradually add the warmed chicken broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly after each addition and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more broth. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through but still has a slight bite to it (al dente)."
7,"Stir in Saffron: Once the rice is nearly cooked, stir in the saffron mixture (including the soaking liquid) and continue to cook for a minute or two."
8,"Finish the Risotto: Off the heat, stir in the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste."
9,"Serve Immediately: Let the risotto rest for a couple of minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley (optional) and serve hot with a lemon wedge for squeezing over the top, if desired."
