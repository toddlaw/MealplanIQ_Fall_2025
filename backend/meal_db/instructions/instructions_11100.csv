Step,Instruction
1,"Brown the beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until fully cooked, approximately 5 to 7 minutes; then drain off any excess grease."
2,"Simmer tomato sauce, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper with the beef mixture over low heat for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and develops a rich flavor."
3,"If I have fresh ingredients available, I use: 1 cup chopped basil, 1 cup chopped oregano, 2 finely chopped onions, or 3 cloves minced garlic as substitutes for dried herbs."
4,This recipe yields enough sauce for two boxes of pasta and can be frozen for later use.
