1,"In a large bowl, combine shredded green cabbage, red cabbage (if using), and shredded carrots."
2,"In a separate bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar (or honey), celery seed, salt, and black pepper. Taste the dressing and adjust seasonings as needed."
3,"Pour the dressing over the shredded vegetables and toss to coat evenly. You can add any of the optional additions at this step, such as chopped fresh parsley, chopped red onion, sliced green onions, or chopped fresh dill."
4,"Let the coleslaw chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the cabbage to soften slightly."
5,"Serve the coleslaw cold as a side dish or topping for sandwiches, burgers, or tacos. Enjoy!"
