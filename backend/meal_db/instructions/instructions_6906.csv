1,"Put the chicken in a large saucepan and add enough water to fully submerge it. Bring to a boil and cook until the chicken is tender. Take off the heat, drain, and let it cool."
2,"Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the tomatoes, jalapeños, and onions until they become soft. Remove the meat from the chicken bones, shred it, and add it to the skillet with the tomatoes and peppers. Fry for a few minutes to enhance the flavor of the chicken."
3,"Heat the cup of canola oil in a clean skillet over medium-high heat. Place approximately 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture into each corn tortilla and roll it up into a cylinder. Fry the filled tortillas in the hot oil until they turn golden, flipping once. Drain on paper towels and serve warm with sour cream or salsa—or both!"
