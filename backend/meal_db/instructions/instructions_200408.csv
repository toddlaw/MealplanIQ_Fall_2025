1,"Preheat oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit."
2,"Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs if present.  You can ask your butcher to do this for you, or use a paper towel to grip the membrane and pull it away from the bone."
3,"In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. This is your dry rub."
4,"Pat the ribs dry with paper towels and season generously with the prepared dry rub on both sides."
5,"Wrap each rack of ribs tightly in aluminum foil, creating a sealed packet."
6,"Place the wrapped ribs on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours."
7,"While the ribs bake, prepare the barbecue sauce. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard (if using). Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a few dashes of hot sauce (optional) for a kick. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired."
8,"After 2 hours of baking, remove the ribs from the oven and carefully unwrap the foil packets. The ribs should be tender but not falling off the bone."
9,"Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit."
10,"Brush the ribs generously with the barbecue sauce on both sides."
11,"Place the ribs back on the baking sheet, uncovered, and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce is caramelized and sticky."
12,"During the last few minutes of broiling (optional), you can broil the ribs on high for an extra crisp on the outside (watch closely to avoid burning).
13,"Let the ribs rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious barbecue ribs!"
