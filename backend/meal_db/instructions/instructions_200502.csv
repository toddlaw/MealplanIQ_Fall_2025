Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the spicy tuna mixture: In a bowl, combine the chopped tuna, sesame oil, mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce (start with 1/2 teaspoon and adjust to your spice preference), and thinly sliced green onion. Mix well to combine."
2,"Prepare the rolling station: Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. This will prevent the rice from sticking to the mat."
3,"Assemble the roll: Place half of the nori seaweed sheet on the plastic-wrapped bamboo mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin and even layer of cooked sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Dip your fingers in water to prevent sticking as you spread the rice."
4,"Add the filling: Arrange a line of the spicy tuna mixture in the center of the rice, closer to the bottom edge."
5,"Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, carefully lift the bottom edge of the mat over the filling. Gently roll the mat forward, applying light pressure to form a tight cylinder. Use the plastic wrap to help you shape the roll and seal the edge."
6,"Shape and cut: Once rolled, remove the bamboo mat and plastic wrap. Moisten a sharp knife with water and cut the roll into 6-8 even pieces."
7,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle the spicy tuna roll pieces with white sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
8,"Serve: Enjoy your spicy tuna roll with wasabi paste and pickled ginger (optional)!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Ensure the tuna is sashimi-grade for safe consumption raw."
2,"Adjust the amount of Sriracha sauce to your desired level of spiciness."
3,"Wetting your fingers with water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while spreading."
4,"If you don't have a bamboo sushi mat, you can use a parchment paper sheet instead."
