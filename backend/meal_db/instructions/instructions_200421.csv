1,"Marinate the Pork: In a medium bowl, toss the pork cubes with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator for extra tender pork."
2,"Prepare the Vegetables (Optional): Julienne the red and green bell peppers and onion (optional) for a more colorful sweet and sour pork."
3,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
4,"Double Coat the Pork: In a separate bowl, whisk the remaining 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with the egg white. Dip the marinated pork cubes into the cornstarch mixture, then coat them again in a fresh layer of cornstarch."
5,"Fry the Pork: Carefully add the pork cubes in batches to the hot oil to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. An internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) is ideal."
6,"Drain the Pork: Transfer the fried pork cubes to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
7,"Make the Sweet and Sour Sauce: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the white vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, pineapple juice (reserved from canned pineapple), and water. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the sauce thickens slightly."
8,"Adjust the Sauce Consistency: If the sauce is too thick, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency."
9,"Add Vegetables (Optional): If using, add the julienned vegetables to the simmering sauce and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened."
10,"Return the Pork: Add the fried pork cubes back to the pan with the sweet and sour sauce. Toss gently to coat the pork in the sauce."
11,"Season and Serve: Season the sweet and sour pork with salt and black pepper to taste. Stir in the drained pineapple chunks and heat through for an additional minute."
12,"Serve immediately with cooked rice and enjoy your delicious sweet and sour pork!"
