**For the Miso Tare (Flavoring Paste):**
1,"Make the miso tare: In a small bowl, whisk together the white miso paste, yellow miso paste (if using), sake, mirin, rice vinegar, chicken broth, and sugar until smooth. Set aside."

**For the Ramen Broth:**
2,"Make the dashi: In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, soaked shiitake mushrooms (reserve soaking liquid), kombu seaweed, smashed garlic, and sliced ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, then remove and discard the kombu seaweed. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the shiitake mushrooms and any solids."

**Assemble the Ramen:**
3,"Heat the broth: Bring the strained broth back to a simmer over medium heat."
4,"Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse briefly with hot water."
5,"Temper the miso tare: To prevent the miso from curdling, ladle a small amount of the hot broth into the miso tare bowl and whisk to loosen the paste. Then whisk the tempered miso mixture back into the main pot of broth."
6,"Do not boil: Once the miso tare is incorporated, reduce heat to low and simmer for a few minutes. Avoid letting the broth come to a full boil, as this can affect the miso flavor."

**Assemble the Bowls:**
7,"Divide the cooked ramen noodles between two serving bowls. Top each bowl with sliced pork belly (if using), ajitsuke tamago halves (if using), and a sheet of nori seaweed."
8,"Ladle the hot miso broth over the noodles and toppings."
9,"Garnish (optional): Garnish with sliced green onions, corn, bean sprouts, or your favorite ramen toppings."
10,"Serve: Enjoy your miso ramen hot and flavorful!"

**Notes:**

* You can adjust the ratio of white miso to yellow miso paste to your taste preference. White miso is sweeter and milder, while yellow miso has a stronger and saltier flavor.
* Tempering the miso tare helps prevent the miso paste from curdling when added to the hot broth.
* Be careful not to let the miso broth come to a full boil, as this can make the miso flavor harsh.
