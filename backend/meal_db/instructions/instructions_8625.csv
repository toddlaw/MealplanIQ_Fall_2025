1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two or three baking sheets."
2,"In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until it becomes light and fluffy. Incorporate the eggs one at a time, ensuring to beat well after each addition. Add the cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt, mixing until thoroughly combined. Gradually add the flour one cup at a time, continuing until the dough forms a cohesive ball. With floured hands, take small portions of dough (about 1/2 teaspoon), roll them into mini balls, and arrange them on the prepared baking sheets."
3,"Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the cookies are a light tan, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes on the baking sheets. Store in an airtight container."
