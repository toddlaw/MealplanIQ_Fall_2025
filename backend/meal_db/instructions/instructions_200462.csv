1,"Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
2,"Do not let the garlic brown. Reduce heat to low if necessary."
3,"Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
4,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and black pepper (to taste)."
5,"Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot slightly, and simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer the sauce, the thicker and richer it will become."
6,"Optional: If the sauce tastes too acidic, you can add a ½ teaspoon of sugar to help balance the flavor."
7,"While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts of water)."
8,"Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes)."
9,"Reserve about ½ cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta completely. This starchy water can help loosen up the sauce if it becomes too thick."
10,"Once the sauce is finished simmering and the pasta is cooked, toss the drained pasta with the marinara sauce in a large bowl or directly in the pot."
11,"Optional: Add a little bit of the reserved pasta water (if needed) to create a smooth and saucy consistency."
12,"Serve the Spaghetti Marinara immediately in warmed bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (to taste). Enjoy!"
