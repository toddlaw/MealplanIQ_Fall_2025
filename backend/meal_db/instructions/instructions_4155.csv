1,"Transfer the chenna to a bowl and knead it for a few minutes until smooth. Divide the mixture into small portions and shape into balls or discs."
2,"Heat oil in a deep pan or kadhai over medium heat. Take a ball of paneer and flatten it slightly to form a disc. Gently slide it into the hot oil and fry until it turns golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels."
3,"Place the milk in the pressure cooker; close the lid and cook for 15 minutes."
4,"Once cooking is done, remove the pressure cooker from heat and let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid and allow the balls to cool in the syrup for a few hours or overnight."
5,"Release the pressure from the cooker while holding it under running water; then remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating in the syrup and have increased in size by 2 to 3 times. Transfer the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Carefully mix in the cardamom. Chill completely in the refrigerator before serving cold."
