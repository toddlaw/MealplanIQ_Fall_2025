1,"In a medium bowl, toss the chicken cubes with cornstarch, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra flavor."
2,"Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until shimmering hot. Add the dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns (if using) and cook for a few seconds, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the chilies."
3,"Using a slotted spoon, remove the chilies and peppercorns (if using) from the oil and discard.  Caution: Sichuan peppercorns are not meant to be eaten whole, as they have a numbing effect on the mouth.
4,"Add the marinated chicken to the hot oil and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown and cooked through."
5,"Remove the cooked chicken from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate."
6,"Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic and ginger to the pan. Cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
7,"Add the chopped bell pepper and sliced water chestnuts to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the bell pepper is slightly softened."
8,"Pour in the white vinegar (if using) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
9,"Add the cooked chicken back to the pan along with the chopped peanuts."
10,"In a small bowl, whisk together the sesame oil (if using), sugar (if using), and a splash of water or chicken broth to create a thin sauce (optional).  Pour the sauce into the pan and toss to coat everything evenly."
11,"Garnish with chopped green onions and serve immediately with steamed rice."
