Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Dough"
1,"In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center."
2,"Pour the warm water and olive oil into the well. Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour from the sides into the wet ingredients until a shaggy dough forms."
3,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Add a little extra water by the tablespoon if the dough feels too dry."
4,"Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour, or until doubled in size."
B,"Prepare the Topping"
5,"Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until softened and caramelized, stirring occasionally. You can add a teaspoon of sugar (optional) to help with the caramelization process."
6,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
7,"**Optional Step (For a Stronger Anchovy Flavor):** Using a fork, mash about half of the anchovy fillets into a paste and add it to the pan with the onions. Sauté for another minute."
8,"Incorporate the remaining whole anchovy fillets, chopped black olives, and chopped Niçoise olives (or Kalamata olives) into the pan with the onions."
9,"Stir in the chopped tomatoes, fresh thyme sprigs, and a few grinds of black pepper. Season with a pinch of salt (be mindful of the saltiness from the anchovies). Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the tomatoes soften and the flavors meld."
C,"Assemble and Bake the Pissaladière"
10,"Preheat your oven to 400°F."
11,"On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch round. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper."
12,"Spread the cooked onion and olive topping evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge."
13,"Bake the pissaladière for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly."
14,"Remove the pissaladière from the oven and discard the thyme sprigs. Let it cool slightly before slicing and serving warm or at room temperature."
15,"Enjoy the pissaladière as a delicious appetizer, light lunch, or savory side dish!"
