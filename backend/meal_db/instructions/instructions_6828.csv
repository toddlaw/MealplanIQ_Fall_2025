1,"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil."
2,"Coat the potatoes with approximately 1 tablespoon of melted butter by tossing them together. Spread them out in a single layer at the bottom of the prepared baking dish."
3,"Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Take the pan out, and move the potatoes to the sides of the dish. Position the chicken breast halves in the center. Combine the leftover butter with lime juice and brush it onto the chicken. Put the dish back in the oven."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. In a small bowl, combine the cheese, cilantro, and salsa. Sprinkle this mixture over the chicken and potatoes. Return to the oven for a few minutes, until the cheese has melted. Serve with lime wedges."
