1,"Wash and dry the cucumbers. Thinly slice the cucumbers into rounds or half-moons. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices (optional)."
2,"In a large bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Whisk until the sugar and salt dissolve."
3,"Add the sliced cucumbers to the bowl with the vinegar mixture. Toss to coat the cucumbers evenly."
4,"Optional: If using red onion, add it to the bowl along with the chopped dill."
5,"Let the salad sit for at least 15 minutes, or up to 2 hours, to allow the flavors to develop. The cucumbers will soften slightly as they marinate."
6,"Just before serving, taste the salad and adjust seasonings with additional salt or sugar as desired."
7,"Garnish with freshly ground black pepper. You can also drizzle with a touch of sesame oil for an extra layer of flavor (optional)."
8,"Serve the sweet and sour cucumber salad chilled as a refreshing side dish or appetizer."
9,"Notes:  This recipe yields approximately 4-6 servings. For a spicier salad, you can add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the dressing. Leftover salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The cucumbers will continue to soften as they sit, so keep that in mind when storing."
