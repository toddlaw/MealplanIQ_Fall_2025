3,"Add the finely diced red onion and stir it into the guacamole. You can adjust the amount of onion depending on your preference."
4,"Optional Step: If using a roma tomato, seed it and dice it finely. Add the diced tomato to the guacamole and stir to combine."
5,"Optional Step: If including a kick of spice, seed and mince a ¼ of a jalapeño pepper. Add it to the guacamole and stir to incorporate."
6,"Finely chop the cilantro and add it to the guacamole. Stir everything together until well combined."
7,"Season the guacamole with salt and a pinch of black pepper (optional) to taste. You can adjust the amount of seasonings to your preference."
