Step,Instruction
1,"Cook the Noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the dried noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 3-5 minutes for thin noodles). Drain the noodles well and rinse them under cold running water to stop the cooking process and cool them down."
2,"Make the Sesame Sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, honey (if using), sriracha (if using), minced garlic, and grated ginger. Gradually whisk in the water, starting with 1/4 cup, until the sauce reaches a desired consistency. It should be slightly thick and pourable."
3,"Optional: Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings with additional soy sauce, rice vinegar, sriracha, or honey to your preference."
4,"Assemble the Cold Noodles: In a large serving bowl, toss the cooked and chilled noodles with the sesame sauce. Make sure the noodles are evenly coated."
5,"Add Your Favorite Garnishes: Top the noodles with your chosen garnishes, such as sliced cucumber, shredded carrots, chopped scallions, toasted sesame seeds, sliced radishes (optional), chopped fresh cilantro (optional), or any other toppings you like."
6,"Serve the cold sesame noodles immediately. Enjoy them as a refreshing and flavorful meal on a hot day."
7,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 4 servings. You can adjust the amount of chili garlic sauce (sriracha) to your desired level of spiciness. Leftover cold sesame noodles can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The noodles may lose some of their texture, but they will still be flavorful."
