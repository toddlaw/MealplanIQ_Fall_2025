1,"Wash and dry the green tomatoes. Slice them horizontally into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick slices. Sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt on each slice (optional) to draw out any bitterness."
2,"In a shallow bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornmeal, Cajun seasoning, salt, and black pepper."
3,"In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs together until well beaten."
4,"Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat to 350Â°F. You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of breadcrumb in the oil - it should sizzle and turn golden brown within seconds."
5,"Dredge each tomato slice in the flour mixture, coating them evenly. Shake off any excess flour."
6,"Dip the floured tomato slice into the beaten egg mixture, coating completely."
7,"Fry the tomato slices in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
8,"Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried green tomatoes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
9,"Serve the fried green tomatoes hot. They can be enjoyed on their own, with a dipping sauce like remoulade or ranch dressing, or on a sandwich or burger."
