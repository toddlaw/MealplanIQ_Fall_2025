1,"Thoroughly rinse the leeks. Trim off the dark green tops and the root end. Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then slice them thinly. Wash the sliced leeks again to remove any dirt or grit."
2,"Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
3,"Add the sliced leeks and cook for an additional 7-8 minutes, or until the leeks are softened and starting to brown slightly. Stir occasionally to prevent burning."
4,"Stir in the chopped potatoes and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld."
5,"Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 30-35 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. You can check for doneness by piercing a potato cube with a fork - it should slide through easily."
6,"While the soup simmers, prepare your garnishes (optional). Thinly slice some chives for a pop of color and freshness."
7,"Once the vegetables are cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly."
8,"Using an immersion blender or a blender in batches, puree the soup until smooth and creamy. Be careful when using a regular blender - fill it no more than halfway and hold the lid down with a kitchen towel while blending to prevent hot soup from erupting."
9,"Return the pur√©ed soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream. Season with nutmeg, salt, and black pepper to taste."
10,"Optional: If the soup is too thick, you can thin it out with a little more chicken broth or milk until you reach your desired consistency."
11,"Chill the soup in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until cold. Vichyssoise is traditionally served chilled."
12,"When ready to serve, ladle the cold soup into bowls. Garnish with a sprinkle of sliced chives (optional) and enjoy!"
