1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8x8 inch baking dish with grease."
2,"Spread the blueberries evenly across the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolk until they become light and fluffy. Add the sugar and keep whisking until the mixture thickens. Gradually whisk in the milk, vanilla extract, sifted flour, and salt, one at a time, until the mixture is light and airy. Pour this mixture over the berries to ensure they are evenly covered."
3,"Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until the top is golden and springs back when pressed, roughly 45 minutes. Let it cool slightly, then cut into 8 equal portions. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve right away."
