1,"Bring chicken broth and water to a boil in a saucepan; take off the heat and mix in the couscous. Cover the saucepan and allow the couscous to sit until the liquid is absorbed and the couscous becomes tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork."
2,"Combine couscous, cucumber, green onions, carrot, and parsley in a large salad bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil and lemon juice, then drizzle it over the couscous and vegetables; stir in cumin, salt, and black pepper into the tabbouleh. Fold in feta cheese right before serving."
3,"Optional: chill overnight to allow flavors to enhance. If you choose to do this, incorporate the cheese just before serving."
