Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the ingredients: Wash and chop the seafood into bite-sized pieces. Chop the scallions and mince the garlic. Thinly slice the red chili pepper (optional)."
2,"Make the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, potato starch (or cornstarch), and cold water until a smooth batter forms. The consistency should be slightly thicker than heavy cream. If the batter seems too thick, gradually add more cold water until it reaches the desired consistency."
3,"Add the egg (optional): If using, whisk the lightly beaten egg into the batter. Season the batter with salt and black pepper to taste."
4,"Incorporate the seafood and vegetables: Fold in the chopped seafood, scallions, minced garlic, and red chili pepper (if using) into the batter. Mix gently to combine without overworking the batter."
5,"Heat a skillet: Heat 1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a large skillet or nonstick pan over medium heat. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan."
6,"Pour the batter: Pour the seafood batter into the hot pan, spreading it evenly to form a round pancake. The thickness should be about ½ inch to ¾ inch."
7,"Cook until golden brown: Cook the pancake for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy on the bottom. You may need to adjust the heat slightly depending on your stovetop."
8,"Flip the pancake: Carefully flip the pancake using a spatula. Press down gently on the edges with the spatula to ensure even cooking. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side, or until the seafood is cooked through and the batter is set."
9,"Serve hot: Transfer the haemul pajeon to a plate and cut it into wedges or desired serving pieces. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce like soy sauce with sesame oil, gochujang sauce, or a simple vinegar sauce."
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the amount of vegetables and spices depending on your preference."
2,"Don't overmix the batter, as it can make the pancake tough."
3,"If the pancake seems to be browning too quickly on the outside but the inside is not cooked through, reduce the heat slightly and cover the pan with a lid for a minute or two to allow the inside to cook."
