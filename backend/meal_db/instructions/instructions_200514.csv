Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the ingredients: Slice the fish cake (odeng) if using, onion, and cabbage thinly. Mince the garlic cloves and chop the scallions (optional) for garnish."
2,"Soak the rice cakes (optional): If your rice cakes are not fresh and soft, soak them in warm water for about 20 minutes to soften them slightly."
3,"Heat the oil: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat."
4,"Saut√© the aromatics: Add the sliced onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
5,"Add the gochujang and garlic: Stir in the gochujang paste and minced garlic. Cook for another minute, stirring constantly, to release the fragrance of the gochujang."
6,"Deglaze the pan (optional): Add a splash of water or broth to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
7,"Add the broth and seasonings: Pour in the Korean fish cake broth (dashi) or water, soy sauce, sugar, and fish sauce (optional). Bring the mixture to a boil."
8,"Add the rice cakes and vegetables: Add the soaked and drained rice cakes (or unsoaked rice cakes), sliced fish cake (if using), and thinly sliced cabbage to the pot. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the rice cakes become soft and chewy, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking."
9,"Adjust consistency (optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, simmer the tteokbokki for a few minutes longer, allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken slightly."
10,"Finish and serve: Once the rice cakes are cooked through and the sauce has reached your desired consistency, remove the pot from heat."
11,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle with chopped scallions and sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
12,"Serve hot: Enjoy your tteokbokki hot with a side of kimchi or pickled vegetables (optional)!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the amount of gochujang depending on your desired level of spiciness."
2,"Feel free to add other vegetables like carrots or green beans."
3,"If you don't have Korean fish cake broth (dashi), you can use water with a teaspoon of kelp powder or a kombu seaweed strip for added umami flavor."
