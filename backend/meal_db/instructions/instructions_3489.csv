1,"Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)."
2,"Combine onion, green bell pepper, egg, garlic, taco seasoning, baking powder, peanut oil, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper in a food processor. Blend until smooth."
3,"Add pinto beans to the mixture and pulse until the beans are chopped and well combined, but still chunky."
4,"Transfer the bean mixture to a large bowl and mix in the hot sauce."
5,"Incorporate enough bread crumbs into the mixture to create a dough that holds together without being sticky."
6,"Shape the dough into balls approximately the size of a quarter."
7,"Deep-fry in hot oil until the falafel are a deep brown color, about 3 to 5 minutes."
8,"If a food processor isn't available, combine the first ten ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Then, use a potato masher to mash the beans in a bowl and mix everything together."
9,"The nutritional value of frying oil has been assessed using a retention value of 10% post-cooking. The precise amount may differ based on cooking duration, temperature, ingredient density, and the particular kind of oil employed."
