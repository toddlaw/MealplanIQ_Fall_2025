1,"In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and eggs. Gradually add milk, stirring until smooth and well combined."
2,"Pour batter into the heated crepe pan and swirl to coat the bottom evenly. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until edges begin to lift and the bottom is lightly browned. Flip the crepe and cook for an additional 1 minute on the other side."
3,"Pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter into the heated pan. Tilt the pan to allow the batter to spread into a round shape. Cook until bubbles appear across the surface, about 2 to 4 minutes. Use a spatula to loosen the crepe from the pan, then quickly flick your wrist upwards to toss it, flipping it back into the pan. Cook the second side until it is lightly browned, around 30 seconds. Continue with the rest of the batter."
4,"If you stack the crepes on a plate while cooking, you wonï¿½t have to worry about the ones that become a bit stiffer. Being in contact with the other warm crepes will make them softer and more pliable. There's no need to place anything in between them, as they won't stick and will easily peel apart."
