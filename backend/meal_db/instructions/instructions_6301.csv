1,"In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla."
2,"In a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/2 cup of sugar until it turns golden. Gently pour the hot sugar evenly into four oven-proof ramekins or custard cups, tilting the cups to ensure the bottoms are coated evenly."
3,"Set the filled ramekins in a baking dish and carefully pour hot water into the dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake in the preheated oven until the custard is set, about 40 to 45 minutes."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven until just set, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove ramekins from water bath and let cool to room temperature before refrigerating for at least 2 hours."
5,"Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until set. Allow to cool, then invert and serve."
