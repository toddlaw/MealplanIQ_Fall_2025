Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the pork belly: Pat the pork belly slices dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Season both sides generously with coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper."
2,"Marinate (optional): For extra flavor, you can marinate the pork belly in sesame oil for 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator. This step is optional."
3,"Heat the grill or grill pan: Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Alternatively, you can use a stovetop grill or a cast iron skillet."
4,"Cook the pork belly: Place the pork belly slices on the preheated grill or pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. You can cut the slices into smaller pieces with kitchen scissors for easier cooking."
5,"Prepare the ssam (wraps): Wash and dry the lettuce leaves and perilla leaves (if using). Arrange them on a plate for easy access."
6,"Prepare the dipping sauces (optional): In separate bowls, prepare your desired dipping sauces. You can use gochujang (Korean chili paste), doenjang (Korean soybean paste), a combination of both, or a mixture with other ingredients like sesame oil, rice vinegar, minced garlic, and chopped scallions."
7,"Assemble and enjoy: Once the pork belly is cooked, use tongs to transfer it to a serving plate. To eat, pick up a piece of lettuce or perilla leaf, add a piece of cooked pork belly, your desired toppings (kimchi, garlic, chilies), and dip it into your chosen sauce before enjoying!"
8,"Serve with accompaniments (optional): Serve the samgyeopsal with kimchi, sliced garlic cloves, chopped green chilies, Korean pancake (buchimgae), and steamed rice for a complete Korean BBQ experience."
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Be careful not to overcrowd the grill or pan, as this can prevent the pork belly from browning properly."
2,"The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the pork belly slices."
3,"Adjust the amount of seasoning and dipping sauce ingredients to your taste preference."
