1,"Prepare the pots for use by scrubbing them in hot soapy water, rinsing well, and allowing them to dry overnight. Apply a coating of vegetable oil to the inside of the pots, including the rim. Place the pots in a cold oven, then heat to 400 degrees. Turn off the heat and let the pots cool in the oven. Once cool, oil them again and repeat the heating process. Ensure thorough greasing before each use, especially around the rim."
2,Melt butter in a small bowl of warm water.
3,"In a separate mixing bowl, combine 4 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Blend in the eggs and the melted butter and water mixture to form a dough. Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, gradually incorporating additional flour as needed. Monitor for blisters on the dough and avoid over-kneading. Lightly oil the top of the dough and allow it to rest in a warm area for 2 to 3 hours."
4,Second rise the dough. Avoid overproofing as it may result in tough bread.
5,Place the dough in two greased terracotta flower pots and allow them to rise for an additional 30 minutes.
6,Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes.
