Step,Instruction
1,"Soak the Beans: Rinse the dried pinto beans thoroughly in cold water. Pick out any discolored or broken beans. Place the rinsed beans in a large bowl and cover them with at least 4 inches of cold water. Soak the beans for at least 8 hours, or overnight, at room temperature."
2,"Drain and Rinse the Beans: After soaking, drain the beans and rinse them again with cold water."
3,"Cook the Beans: In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the soaked and rinsed beans with the chicken broth. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 60-90 minutes, or until the beans are tender but not mushy. You may need to add more chicken broth during cooking if the beans become dry."
4,"While the Beans Cook, Prepare the Savory Ingredients: In a separate skillet over medium heat, cook the chopped bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Reserve some of the bacon grease in the skillet."
5,"Sauté the Vegetables: Add the diced yellow onion and jalapeño pepper (if using) to the remaining bacon grease in the skillet. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until the onion is softened and translucent."
6,"Add More Flavor: Stir in the diced Roma tomatoes, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (optional), and minced garlic. Sauté for an additional minute, allowing the flavors to meld."
7,"Season the Bean Broth: Add the ground cumin, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper (optional) to the simmering pot of beans and broth. Stir to combine the seasonings."
8,"Incorporate the Sautéed Mixture: Once the vegetables in the skillet have softened, add them along with the cooked and cubed ham to the pot with the beans and broth."
9,"Simmer and Finish: Continue to simmer the Charro Beans for another 15-20 minutes, or until the flavors have developed and the beans are heated through. If the beans seem too soupy, simmer for a few minutes longer to thicken slightly."
10,"Serve: Enjoy Charro Beans hot as a side dish or main course. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro (optional) and reserved crispy bacon bits for added flavor and texture."
11,"Optional Slow Cooker Method: You can also cook this recipe in a slow cooker. Combine all the ingredients (soaked and rinsed beans, chicken broth, bacon, ham, vegetables, spices) in the slow cooker. Cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-5 hours, or until the beans are tender."
