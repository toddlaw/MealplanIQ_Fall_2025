1,"Set your oven to preheat at 300 degrees F. Then, take an 8x8-inch baking dish and lightly grease it before dusting it with flour."
2,"Combine the sugar and the butter, then beat them until they are light and fluffy, which should take about 3 minutes. Following this, beat in the eggs and lime juice. After that, stir in the flour and baking powder into the butter mixture until they are thoroughly combined. Pour this finished batter into your pre-prepared baking dish."
3,"Cook in the pre-set oven until a deep brown color, testing with a toothpick for readiness; should come out clean, about 25 minutes in total. Top with a sprinkling of diced peanuts for garnish."
