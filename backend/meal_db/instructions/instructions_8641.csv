1,"Rub an 8-inch square pan generously with butter and set it aside."
2,"Combine milk, water, sugar, and butter in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat while stirring constantly. Lower the heat and let it simmer until a candy thermometer reads 234 to 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens once taken out of the water and set on a flat surface, which should take about 10 minutes."
3,"Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Allow to cool for a bit before cutting into squares."
4,"Beat the mixture with an electric hand mixer for five minutes until it cools and starts to solidify. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and mark into serving-sized portions while it is still pliable. Let it cool until fully set, which may take 6 hours to overnight."
