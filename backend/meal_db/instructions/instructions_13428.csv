1,Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) and grease multiple baking sheets.
2,"Combine the eggs, white sugar, brown sugar, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the almonds, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, allspice, and cloves until well mixed. Gradually add the flour to form a sticky dough."
3,"Knead the dough on a floured surface for 1 to 2 minutes, adding extra flour if necessary, until you achieve a smooth consistency. Shape pieces of dough into 1 1/2-inch diameter balls and arrange them on the greased baking sheets, leaving at least 1 inch of space between each ball."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cookie comes out clean, approximately 25 minutes. Transfer the cookies from the baking sheets to cooling racks right away to avoid them becoming too firm."
5,"Glaze the cookies by stirring together confectioners' sugar and water to create a smooth mixture. Drizzle each cookie with about 1/2 teaspoon of glaze while they are slightly warm, spreading it evenly across the top of the cookie."
