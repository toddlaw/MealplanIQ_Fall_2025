1,"Combine the celery, onions, and garlic in a saucepan and simmer in chicken broth. ^Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease or line baking sheets. ^Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl."
2,"Cream butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Incorporate eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract and orange juice. Slowly add the flour mixture to create a dough."
3,"Cut out shapes from the dough using cookie cutters, ensuring the cutters are floured to prevent sticking. Transfer the shapes to the baking sheets."
4,"Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Use cookie cutters dipped in flour to cut out holiday shapes. Place the cutouts onto prepared baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, around 10 to 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool briefly on the baking sheets before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Spread holiday cheer with these delicious treats!"
