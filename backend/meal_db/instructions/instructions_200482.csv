1,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the shallots (or onion) and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent browning."
2,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
3,"Pour in the white wine and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly reduced."
4,"Whisk in the heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, dried thyme, and dried parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened."

6,"If using frozen seafood, thaw it completely before adding it to the sauce."
7,"Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mixed seafood to the pan with the creamy sauce. Gently stir to combine the seafood with the sauce."
8,"Cover the pan and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through and opaque."
9,"Optional: If using fresh pasta, you can add it directly to the pan with the seafood sauce in the last minute or two of cooking, allowing it to cook and absorb the flavors of the sauce."
10,"If using cooked pasta: Add the drained pasta to the pan with the seafood and creamy sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly."
11,"Optional: Stir in the fresh parsley and lemon juice (if using) to the pasta and seafood mixture. Toss to combine and heat through for an additional minute."
