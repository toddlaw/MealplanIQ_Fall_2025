1,"Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius)."
2,"In a medium saucepan, heat water until it boils. Incorporate butter and mix until it has melted, then bring back to a boil. Gradually add flour and salt together and stir energetically until the mixture forms a ball. Take the saucepan off the heat and mix in the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition until the mixture is smooth. Spoon heaping tablespoons onto a cookie sheet, spacing them 3 inches apart."
3,"Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then lower the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking for an additional 25 minutes. Take the puffs out of the oven, cut them open, and discard the soft dough from the inside. Turn off the oven and return the puffs to dry in the residual heat for 20 more minutes. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack."
4,"In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to whip the cream until stiff peaks appear. Mix in the vanilla and sugar. Stuff the puffs with the whipped cream. Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave or gently over low heat. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the tops of the cream puffs. Serve right away."
