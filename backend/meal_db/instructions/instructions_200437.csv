1,"Cook the Noodles: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lo mein noodles according to package instructions, usually for 3-5 minutes. Drain the noodles thoroughly and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Toss the noodles with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to prevent sticking."
2,"Marinate the Shrimp (Optional): If using shrimp, toss them with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and a pinch of white pepper in a bowl. Marinate for 15 minutes for extra flavor (optional)."
3,"Whisk the Eggs: In a small bowl, whisk the eggs together with a splash of water until well combined."
4,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
5,"Scramble the Eggs: Push the oil to the sides of the wok. Pour in the whisked eggs and scramble them quickly until cooked through. Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and set aside."
6,"Stir-fry the Shrimp (Optional): If using shrimp, add them to the hot wok and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes per side, or until pink and cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the wok and set aside on a plate."
7,"Stir-fry the Vegetables: Add the red bell pepper and snow peas (or broccoli florets) to the wok and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened."
8,"Add the Garlic and Ginger: Add the minced garlic and ginger to the wok and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
9,"Push the Vegetables Aside: Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok to make space in the center."
10,"Pour in the Soy Sauce and Oyster Sauce: Add the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) to the center of the wok. Stir-fry for a few seconds to deglaze the pan and release any browned bits."
11,"Add the Noodles: Add the cooked and drained lo mein noodles back to the wok with the vegetables and sauces."
12,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the noodles in the sauce."
13,"Add the Scrambled Eggs and Shrimp (Optional): Add the cooked scrambled eggs and shrimp (if using) back to the wok and toss again to combine."
14,"Season with Sesame Oil and Pepper: Drizzle the toasted sesame oil over the lo mein and stir-fry for another minute. Season with white pepper to taste."
15,"Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious and flavorful shrimp lo mein!"
