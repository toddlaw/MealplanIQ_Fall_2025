step,instruction
1,"Prepare the ingredients: Slice the pork belly, kimchi, tofu, and green onions. Thinly slice the onion and mince the garlic cloves."
2,"Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the pork belly and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the pork belly from the pot and set aside."
3,"Add the kimchi and kimchi juice to the pot. Saut√© for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, to soften the kimchi slightly."
4,"Pour in the water and Korean anchovy broth (if using). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes."
5,"Add the gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and fish sauce to the simmering broth. Adjust the amount of gochugaru to your desired level of spiciness. Simmer for another 5 minutes."
6,"Add the tofu, cooked pork belly (from step 2), and any additional ingredients you're using (spam, mushrooms) to the pot. Simmer for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the tofu is heated through." 
7,"Taste and adjust seasonings: Add more fish sauce or gochugaru if needed. Season with a pinch of salt (if necessary) considering the sodium content of kimchi and fish sauce."
8,"Serve hot: Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped green onions. Ladle the kimchi jjigae into bowls and enjoy hot with rice."
