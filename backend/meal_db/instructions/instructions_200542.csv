1,"In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened."
2,"Add diced red bell pepper and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until softened and slightly charred."
3,"Stir in the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Cook for another minute, allowing the spices to toast and become fragrant."
4,"Add the cooked and shredded chicken to the pan. Mix well to combine with the vegetables and spices. Heat through for a few minutes."
5,"Taste the filling and adjust seasonings as needed (salt, pepper, additional spices)."
6,"Optional: Stir in chopped fresh cilantro for a burst of freshness (add just before assembling quesadillas)."
7,"Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. You can also use a non-stick pan or a crepe maker."
8,"Place one flour tortilla on the hot skillet. Sprinkle about 0.75 cups of shredded cheese on one half of the tortilla."
9,"Top the cheese with a generous portion of the chicken filling. You can add other desired toppings like salsa, sour cream, or pickled jalapenos at this point."
10,"Fold the empty half of the tortilla over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press down gently with a spatula to ensure good contact between the tortilla and filling."

12,"Repeat steps 8-11 to cook the remaining quesadillas. You may need to adjust the heat slightly depending on your pan."
13,"Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve immediately. Enjoy with your favorite toppings and sides like guacamole, salsa, or sour cream."
