1,"Whisk the cornstarch, salt, sugar, and cinnamon together in a large saucepan. Gradually stir in the milk to combine the ingredients evenly, then place over medium-high heat. Keep whisking continuously while cooking until the custard thickens, which should take about 25 to 30 minutes. It's crucial to stir constantly to prevent the custard from burning or clumping. The custard will thicken further as it cools. Spoon into bowls for serving."
