1,"Combine flour and salt in a food processor. Add butter and process until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, pulsing until the dough starts coming together in clumps. Transfer the dough from the processor to a floured surface, shaping it into a ball. Let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before rolling it out."
2,"Roll out the dough on a floured surface to fit the pie pan. Transfer the dough into the pan, crimp the edges, and prick the bottom with a fork. Chill in the freezer for 15-20 minutes while preheating the oven to 425 degrees F."
3,"Bake the crust filled with beans or pie weights in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Then, remove the pie weights and bake for an additional 5 minutes. If needed, cover with foil to avoid excess browning."
