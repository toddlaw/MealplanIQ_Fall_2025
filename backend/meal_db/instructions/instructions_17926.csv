1,"Brown chops in the hot oil for about 5 minutes on each side. Remove the pork from the skillet to a plate, keeping the oil in the skillet."
2,"Stir-fry garlic in the reserved oil for about a minute until fragrant. Prepare a sauce by whisking together beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and red pepper flakes. Add pork chops back to the skillet and pour the sauce over them. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat until the chops are tender, turning them halfway through cooking."
3,"Whisk cornstarch with water in a small bowl until smooth; add to pan juices and simmer until thickened, approximately 5 minutes. Serve the sauce over the chops."
