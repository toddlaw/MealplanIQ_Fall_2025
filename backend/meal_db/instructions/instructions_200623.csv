Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Filling"
1,"In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, chopped Napa cabbage, minced garlic, grated ginger, sliced scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and cornstarch. Mix well with your hands until everything is evenly incorporated."
B,"Make the Gyoza"
2,"Prepare a Work Surface:** Have a plate with a damp paper towel nearby to keep the gyoza wrappers from drying out."
3,"Fill and Fold the Wrappers:** Place one gyoza wrapper on a flat surface.  Using a spoon, place a small amount of filling (about 1 tablespoon) in the center of the wrapper."
4,"Moisten the Edges:** Dip your finger in the water bowl and moisten the top half-moon of the wrapper."
5,"Fold and Pleat:**  Fold the wrapper in half over the filling, forming a crescent shape. Press down on the edges to seal.  **Optional Pleating:**  Starting from one end of the sealed edge, make small pleats along the top edge, working your way towards the other end. This creates a decorative and secure closure."
6,"Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-5 to fill and fold all the remaining gyoza wrappers."
C,"Cook the Gyoza"
7,"Heat Oil in a Pan: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, carefully arrange the gyoza in a single layer in the pan, leaving some space between them."
8,"Sear the Gyoza: Sear the gyoza for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy."
9,"Add Water and Steam:  Pour the Â¼ cup of water into the pan. Immediately cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and bring the water to a simmer."
10,"Steam the Gyoza: Steam the gyoza for 4-5 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the liquid has evaporated."
11,"Crisp Up (Optional): Once most of the liquid has evaporated, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
12,"Serve Hot: Transfer the cooked gyoza to a serving plate. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce options like soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili oil (optional), and a sprinkle of sesame seeds (optional)."
E,"Tips:"
1,"If the wrappers become dry while working, cover them with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out and cracking."
2,"You can pan-fry all the gyoza at once, or cook them in batches depending on the size of your pan."
3,"Leftover cooked gyoza can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them gently in a skillet with a little oil until crispy or by steaming them again."
