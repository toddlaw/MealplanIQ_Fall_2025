1,"Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl; then add the egg, milk, butter, and vanilla, mixing until just combined."
2,"Pour the batter into each well of the aebleskiver pan until about three-quarters full. Cook until bubbles form and edges look set, about 3 minutes."
3,"Pour the batter into each cup until they are about 2/3 full. Let the batter cook in the bottom of the cup for 3 to 4 minutes until it turns golden brown. Remember which cup you filled first, as it's important to rotate! Use a long skewer or knitting needle to lift one edge and rotate it a quarter turn. The uncooked batter will spill into the cup and begin to cook. Keep lifting and turning the edges until the batter is fully cooked and forms a golden brown ball. Drain on paper towels."
4,"These are also delicious when stuffed. Consider using chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, jam, honey, Nutella(R), peanut butter, coconut, cranberries, raisins, blueberries, and pie fillings (not the healthiest but incredibly tasty). Just fill the cup about 1/3 full and add the filling in the center of the batter."
