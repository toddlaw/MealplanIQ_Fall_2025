step,instruction
Part A,"Prepare the Filling"
1,"In a large mixing bowl, combine cooked, shredded chicken breast, refried beans (optional), chopped green chiles, salsa, and shredded cheese. Mix well to combine and distribute the flavors evenly."
Part B,"Assemble the Chimichangas"
2,"Spread a generous portion of the filling in the center of a flour tortilla. Leave about 1 inch of border around the edges."
3,"Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up over the filling. Then fold the sides of the tortilla inward, like a burrito."
4,"Carefully roll up the tortilla tightly to enclose the filling completely. You can dip your finger in a little water and moisten the top edge of the tortilla to help seal it shut."
Part C,"Cooking the Chimichangas"
5,"Frying Method: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat to a depth of about 1/2 inch. The oil should be shimmering hot but not smoking."
6,"Carefully place one chimichanga at a time into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain the fried chimichangas on paper towels to remove excess oil."
7,"Baking Method: Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with canola oil. Place the assembled chimichangas seam-side down on the baking sheet."
8,"Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. You can flip the chimichangas halfway through baking for even browning."
Part D,"Serve and Enjoy!"
9,"Serve the chimichangas hot with your desired toppings like sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges. Enjoy this delicious and satisfying Tex-Mex dish!"
