1,"Marinate the Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and a pinch of salt. Let the chicken marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tender chicken."
2,"Prepare the Coating: In a shallow dish, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and the all-purpose flour. In another shallow dish, whisk the eggs with a splash of water."
3,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
4,"Double Coat the Chicken: Dip each piece of marinated chicken in the egg mixture, then dredge it in the cornstarch-flour mixture to coat evenly. Repeat the dipping and dredging process for a thicker, crispier coating (optional)."
5,"Fry the Chicken: Carefully add the chicken pieces in batches to the hot oil to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature)."
6,"Drain the Chicken: Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
7,"Make the Orange Sauce: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the orange juice, chicken broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes (optional). Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the sauce thickens slightly."
8,"Add the Orange Zest: Stir in the grated orange zest for an extra burst of orange flavor."
9,"Return the Chicken: Add the fried chicken back to the pan with the simmering orange sauce. Toss gently to coat the chicken in the sauce."
10,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the chicken."
11,"Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious homemade orange chicken!"
