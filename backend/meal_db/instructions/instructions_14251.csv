Step,Instruction
1,Heat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2,"Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Incorporate the shortening using a pastry blender or by rubbing it between your fingers until the lumps are smaller than peas. Add the milk all at once and mix with a large spoon until the dough is evenly moist and sticky."
3,"Knead the dough lightly with floured hands for 3 or 4 turns, adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking.-Allow the dough to rest for a couple of minutes."
4,"Shape dough into 12 balls, patting lightly with well-floured hands. Place them about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Use floured knuckles to press each ball down to about 1/2 inch thickness."
5,Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 11 to 12 minutes until they are browned at the bottom. Serve them hot with butter.
