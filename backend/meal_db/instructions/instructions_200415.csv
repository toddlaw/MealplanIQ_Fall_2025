step,instruction
Part A,"Prepare the Brisket"
1,"Trim any excess fat from the brisket, leaving a thin layer (about 1/4 inch) for flavor. Pat the brisket dry with paper towels to remove surface moisture."
2,"Season the brisket generously on all sides with coarse black pepper and kosher salt. Use a good amount of pressure to press the seasoning into the meat."
Prepare the Rub:
3,"In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using)."
Part B,"Smoke the Brisket"
4,"Prepare your smoker for indirect heat at 225 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use wood chips like hickory or oak for added smokiness (optional)."
5,"Apply a thin layer of yellow mustard all over the seasoned brisket. This helps the rub adhere to the meat."
6,"Sprinkle the prepared rub evenly over the entire surface of the mustard-coated brisket."
7,"Place the seasoned brisket fat-side up on the smoker grate (not directly over the heat source). If using a water pan, fill it halfway with water and place it underneath the brisket (optional)."
8,"Smoke the brisket for 6-8 hours, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) in the thickest part. Spritz the brisket occasionally with apple cider vinegar (optional) to help maintain moisture."
Part C,"Wrap the Brisket (Optional)"
9,"(Optional) For a more tender and juicy brisket, you can wrap it in butcher paper or aluminum foil during the last 2-3 hours of smoking. Wrapping helps trap moisture and steam the brisket, resulting in a softer texture."
10,"To wrap, carefully remove the brisket from the smoker and place it on a large sheet of butcher paper or aluminum foil. Add a tablespoon or two of beef broth or apple juice to the bottom of the wrapping material (optional) for additional moisture. Wrap the brisket tightly, sealing all the edges."
11,"Return the wrapped brisket to the smoker and continue cooking until it reaches an internal temperature of 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit in the thickest part. This is considered the ideal temperature for tender, pull-apart barbecue brisket."
Part D,"Rest the Brisket"
12,"Once the brisket reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from the smoker and let it rest for at least 1-2 hours before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more flavorful and tender brisket."
13,"To rest, place the wrapped brisket in a cooler or large insulated container. The residual heat will continue to cook the brisket slightly while it rests."
Part E,"Serve and Enjoy"
14,"Unwrap the rested brisket and slice it against the grain (thin slices are recommended). Serve your delicious barbecue brisket with your favorite barbecue sauce and sides."
