Step,Instruction
1,"Preparing the Nopales"
1a,"Fresh Nopales Pads: Wear gloves for this step as nopales can be slimy. Rinse the fresh nopales pads thoroughly under cold running water. Using a sharp knife, carefully trim off the spines from the edges of the pads. Cut the pads into thin slices or small cubes."
1b,"Canned Nopales Pads: If using canned nopales, simply drain and rinse them well under cold running water to remove any brine or sliminess."
2,"In a large pot, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the nopales slices or cubes and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Drain the cooked nopales in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process."
3,"While the nopales are cooking, prepare the remaining ingredients. Seed and dice the roma tomato, red onion, and jalapeño pepper (if using). Finely chop the cilantro and mince the garlic clove."
4,"In a large bowl, combine the cooked and cooled nopales, diced tomato, red onion, jalapeño pepper (if using), and chopped cilantro."
5,"In a separate small bowl, whisk together the lime juice and olive oil to create a dressing. Season the dressing with salt and black pepper (optional) to taste."
6,"Pour the dressing over the nopales mixture and toss to coat evenly."
7,"Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You can add more lime juice for acidity or more salt for flavor."
8,"Optional Steps:"  
8a,"For added protein, crumble Queso Fresco cheese or Cotija cheese over the salad."
8b,"Dice half of an avocado and add it to the salad for creaminess."
8c,"Include diced orange bell pepper for extra color and sweetness."
9,"Cover the bowl and refrigerate the Ensalada de Nopales for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Chilling also helps the nopales absorb the dressing and become more flavorful."
10,"Serve Ensalada de Nopales cold as a side dish or a light vegetarian meal. Enjoy!"
