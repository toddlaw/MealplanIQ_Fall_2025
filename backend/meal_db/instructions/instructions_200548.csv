Part A,"Prepare the Beef Tripe"
1, "Clean the beef tripe thoroughly. Rinse it under cold running water for several minutes, removing any excess fat and tissue. You can also soak the tripe in cold water with vinegar or lemon juice for 1-2 hours to help remove any impurities."
2, "Cut the tripe into bite-sized pieces. You can cut it into strips, squares, or small cubes depending on your preference."
3, "In a large pot, combine the tripe, water, whole lime, bay leaves, peppercorns, and a pinch of salt. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the tripe is very tender. You may need to skim off any scum that rises to the surface during cooking."
4, "After simmering, remove the cooked tripe from the pot with a slotted spoon and set it aside to cool slightly. Discard the bay leaves, peppercorns, and lime from the cooking liquid."
Part B,"Prepare the Soup Base"
5, "While the tripe cools, prepare the soup base. In a separate pot, combine beef or chicken broth, hominy, dried chiles, garlic cloves, chopped onion, cumin, oregano, and salt to taste. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat."
6, "Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the hominy is cooked through and the chiles are softened. You can remove the stems and seeds from the chiles before adding them for a milder soup, or leave them in for a spicier flavor."
7, "After simmering, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly. Using an immersion blender or a blender in batches, blend the soup base until slightly smooth. You can leave it slightly chunky or blend it until completely smooth depending on your preference."
Part C,"Assemble and Serve"
8, "Return the cooked tripe and any accumulated juices back to the pot with the blended soup base. Bring the soup to a simmer over low heat and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until heated through."
9, "Taste the soup and adjust seasonings as needed with additional salt, pepper, or a squeeze of lime juice."
10, "Serve the menudo hot in bowls. Garnish with chopped white onion, chopped fresh oregano, lime wedges, and your favorite toppings like toasted tortillas, salsa, avocado slices, sour cream, and jalapenos."
