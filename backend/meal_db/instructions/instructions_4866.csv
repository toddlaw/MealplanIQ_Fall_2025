1,"To prepare the starter: Combine 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water in a bowl with a lid; mix thoroughly. Cover and allow it to sit at room temperature overnight. The following day, add another 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water to the bowl. Cover and let it sit at room temperature overnight again. On the third day, repeat by adding 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water to the bowl, cover, and let it rest at room temperature overnight."
2,"In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water; let it sit until creamy, approximately 10 minutes."
3,"Break the starter into small bits and mix it into the yeast mixture. Add 4 cups of flour and salt, then incorporate the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Once the dough has formed, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Dust the dough with a bit of flour and cover it with a clean cloth. Allow it to rise until it has doubled in size."
4,"Put the dough back onto a lightly floured work surface and punch it down to remove the air. Divide the dough into two halves and knead each half for 2 to 3 minutes. Shape each piece into a tight oval loaf. Sprinkle cornmeal on two sheet pans. Roll and stretch the loaves until they form 15x12-inch ovals. Dust the tops of the loaves with flour. Cover them with a dry cloth and let them rise in a warm area until doubled in size. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)."
5,"Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, misting with water three times during the first 15 minutes. The loaves are ready when the bottoms sound hollow when tapped. Allow them to cool on wire racks before serving."
