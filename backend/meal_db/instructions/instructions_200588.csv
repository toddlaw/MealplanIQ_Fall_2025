Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the Filling: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
2,"Add the shredded carrots, green or white cabbage, and red bell pepper (if using) to the pan. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened."
3,"Add the bean sprouts and cook for another minute, until just heated through."
4,"In a separate bowl, combine the cooked vermicelli noodles, soy sauce, light brown sugar, white pepper, and salt. Toss to coat the noodles evenly."
5,"Optional: If using, stir in the chopped fresh cilantro to the noodle mixture."
6,"Assemble the Spring Rolls:** Fill a shallow bowl with warm water for dipping the rice paper wrappers."
7,"Dip a single rice paper wrapper into the water for a few seconds, just until softened and pliable. Carefully transfer the wrapper to a clean work surface."
8,"Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of the softened wrapper. Spread the filling out in a thin layer, leaving about 1 inch of space on the sides."
9,"Fold the bottom edge of the wrapper over the filling. Then, fold in the sides of the wrapper tightly to enclose the filling."
10,"Continue rolling the wrapper tightly, forming a cylindrical shape. Moisten the top edge of the wrapper with a little water to seal the roll."
11,"Repeat steps 6-10 to assemble the remaining spring rolls with the filling and wrappers."
12,"Optional:** You can lightly fry the spring rolls for a crispier texture. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the spring rolls for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil."
13,"Serve:** Serve the vegetable spring rolls hot or at room temperature with your favorite dipping sauces, such as sweet chili sauce, peanut sauce, or a simple lime wedge."
14,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 10 spring rolls. You can adjust the vegetables in the filling based on your preference. Other options include shredded zucchini, mushrooms, or chopped bok choy. Leftover spring rolls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The wrappers may become slightly chewy, but they will still be edible."
