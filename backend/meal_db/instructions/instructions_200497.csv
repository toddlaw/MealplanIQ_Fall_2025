step,instruction
Part A,"For the Tonkotsu Broth"
1,"Blanch the bones: In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the pork bones and chicken feet (if using) to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse the bones thoroughly under cold running water. This removes impurities that can cloud the broth."
2,"Make the broth: Return the blanched bones to the pot. Add the quartered onion, sliced ginger, smashed garlic, chopped scallions, black peppercorns, and enough water to cover the bones by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer partially covered for 12-14 hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface occasionally."
3,"Strain the broth: After simmering, carefully strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth. Discard the solids and set the broth aside to cool slightly."
4,"Skim the fat: Once the broth is cool enough to handle, skim off any excess fat that has solidified on the surface. You can use a spoon or ladle to remove the fat layer."
Part B,"For the Tare (Flavoring Sauce)"
5,"Combine the tare ingredients: In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, fish sauce, chicken broth, and brown sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Remove from heat and let cool completely."
Part C,"Assemble the Ramen"
6,"Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse briefly with hot water."
7,"Heat the broth: Reheat the tonkotsu broth to a simmer over medium heat."
8,"Assemble the bowls: Divide the cooked ramen noodles between two serving bowls. Top each bowl with sliced pork belly (if using), ajitsuke tamago halves (if using), and a sheet of nori seaweed. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and toppings."
9,"Garnish (optional): Garnish with sliced green onions, wood ear mushrooms, baby bok choy, or your favorite ramen toppings."
10,"Serve: Enjoy your tonkotsu ramen hot and flavorful!"
Part D,"Notes"
1,"Making tonkotsu broth requires a long simmering time. You can prepare the broth in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for longer storage."
2,"Chashu pork and ajitsuke tamago are delicious additions to tonkotsu ramen, but feel free to customize with your favorite toppings."
3,"Adjust the amount of tare (flavoring sauce) to your taste preference for a stronger or milder flavored broth."
