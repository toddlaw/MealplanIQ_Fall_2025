1,"Wash the potatoes thoroughly under cold running water. You can use a vegetable brush to remove any dirt or blemishes."
2,"**Two Cutting Options:**  
    * Leave the potatoes whole if using baby potatoes (recommended). 
    * For larger potatoes, cut them into bite-sized pieces."
3,"Place the potatoes in a pot and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat."
4,"Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a colander."
5,"While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the braising sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, sugar (if using), minced garlic, sesame oil, and a pinch of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) if using for a touch of spice. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce, honey, and gochugaru depending on your taste preference."
6,"Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add a drizzle of oil (optional) if not using enough sesame oil in the sauce."
7,"**Optional Step:** You can also use the leftover pot from boiling the potatoes if there's a bit of residual water â€“ this will help deglaze any browned bits." 
8,"Add the drained potatoes to the hot skillet and sear them for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until slightly golden brown."
9,"Pour the prepared braising sauce into the pan with the potatoes. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the potatoes evenly."
10,"**Optional Step:** During the last minute of cooking, you can add a sprinkle of black pepper for a touch of heat."
11,"Turn off the heat and let the Algamja Jorim sit in the pan for a few minutes to allow the flavors to further develop."
12,"Transfer the Algamja Jorim to a serving dish and garnish with sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onion (optional)."
13,"Serve Algamja Jorim warm or at room temperature as a side dish with Korean meals. It also pairs well with rice bowls."
