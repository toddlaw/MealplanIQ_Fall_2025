Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Risotto"
1,"In a large saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes."
2,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
3,"Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat with the butter. Cook for a minute, stirring constantly, to toast the rice slightly."
4,"Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is almost completely absorbed."
5,"Gradually Add Broth:  Gradually add the warmed vegetable broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more broth. Continue this process until all the broth is used up, and the rice is cooked through but still has a slight bite to it, about 18-20 minutes."
6,"Stir in Cheese and Seasonings: Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste."
7,"Let the risotto cool slightly, about 10-15 minutes. This allows the risotto to firm up for easier shaping."
B,"Prepare the Filling (Optional)"
8,"In a small bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella cheese, chopped cooked ham, and peas.  **Note:** You can adjust the filling ingredients to your preference. Other options include diced cooked vegetables, shredded chicken, or a mixture of cheeses."
C,"Assemble the Arancini"
9,"Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the cooled risotto and flatten it into a circle in your palm."
10,"Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the risotto circle."
11,"Carefully fold the risotto around the filling to completely enclose it. Shape the filled risotto into a ball, rolling it gently between your palms."
12,"Prepare the Coating Station:** Set up three shallow bowls in a row. Fill the first bowl with flour, the second bowl with whisked eggs, and the third bowl with panko breadcrumbs.
13,"Dredge each arancini ball in the flour, then coat it completely in the whisked egg, and finally roll it in the panko breadcrumbs to coat evenly."
D,"Fry the Arancini"
14,"Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a temperature of 350Â°F. You can use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature."
15,"Fry in Batches: Carefully add a few arancini balls at a time to the hot oil and fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside."
16,"Drain on Paper Towels: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried arancini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil."
17,"Serve and Enjoy: Let the arancini cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm and crispy as an appetizer, snack, or light lunch."
