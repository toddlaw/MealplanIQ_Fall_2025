1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente (typically 8-10 minutes)."
2,"While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Be careful not to let the butter brown."
3,"Add the minced garlic to the melted butter and cook for about 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
4,"Optional: If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, you can add the garlic a little later after the butter has melted and cooked for a minute, but before it browns."
5,"Pour in the heavy cream and whisk to combine with the melted butter and garlic. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly."
6,"Reserve about Â½ cup of the pasta water before draining the pasta. This starchy pasta water can be used to thin out the alfredo sauce if it becomes too thick."
7,"Drain the cooked pasta and immediately add it to the pan with the alfredo sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce."
8,"Optional: If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until the desired consistency is reached."
9,"Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and incorporated into the sauce."
10,"Season the fettuccine alfredo with salt and pepper to taste."
11,"Serve immediately, garnished with chopped fresh parsley (optional)."
