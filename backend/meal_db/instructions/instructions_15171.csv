Step,Instruction
1,Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) and move a heavy baking sheet to the top rack to preheat.
2,"Sprinkle 1 teaspoon flour, or as needed, onto a clean work surface and a rolling pin."
3,"Pour water into the flour in the mixing bowl, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring with a fork until a rough ball of dough forms. Set a timer for 16 minutes (maximum 18 minutes)."
4,"Place the dough on the floured surface; knead quickly and firmly until it becomes smooth, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute."
5,"Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, then cut each portion in half to yield 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball swiftly. Roll out each piece from the center, starting at 5 inches in diameter and gradually increasing to about 8 inches, allowing the dough to rest occasionally. Repeat until the dough rounds are thin."
6,"Take a fork and pierce each dough round quickly about 25 times all over to prevent rising. Then, flip the dough over and repeat the process by piercing each piece 25 times."
7,"With a minimum of 5 minutes remaining on the timer, take out the hot baking sheet from the preheated oven and position the dough rounds on it."
8,"Bake on the top rack in the preheated oven for 2 minutes, then flip matzah over and bake for about 2 more minutes until lightly browned and crisp."
9,Move the baked matzah to a cooling rack. Drizzle each piece lightly with olive oil using a brush. Sprinkle generously with salt.
