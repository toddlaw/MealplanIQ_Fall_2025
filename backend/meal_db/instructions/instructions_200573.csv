1,"In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, sliced shiitake mushrooms, and sliced bamboo shoots. Bring to a boil over high heat."
2,"Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender."
3,"Whisk together the white vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, and white pepper in a small bowl. Add the mixture to the simmering broth."
4,"In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the hot broth to thicken it slightly. Be careful not to over-thicken the soup."
5,"Optional: If using shredded chicken, tofu, or shrimp, add them to the pot and heat through for a few minutes."
6,"Slowly drizzle the beaten eggs into the simmering broth, whisking constantly to create thin egg ribbons."
7,"Optional: If using red chili flakes or minced ginger, add them to the soup for a touch of extra spice or flavor (adjust to your preference)."
8,"Taste the soup and adjust seasonings with additional soy sauce, vinegar, salt, or white pepper as needed."
9,"Serve the hot-and-sour soup immediately garnished with chopped green onions."
