1,"Marinate the Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using, and a pinch of white pepper. Let the chicken marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tender chicken."
2,"Prepare the Coating: In a shallow dish, whisk together the remaining 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch. In another shallow dish, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and sesame oil (optional)."
3,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
4,"Double Coat the Chicken: Dip each piece of marinated chicken in the cornstarch mixture, then coat it in the soy sauce mixture. Repeat the cornstarch and soy sauce coating process for a thin, flavorful crust."
5,"Fry the Chicken: Carefully add the chicken pieces in batches to the hot oil to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature)."
6,"Drain the Chicken: Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
7,"Prepare the Sichuan Sauce: In a separate wok or skillet, heat a drizzle of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the dried red chilies and toast them for a few seconds until fragrant (be careful not to burn them). Be mindful of the fumes from the chilies, which can irritate the eyes."
8,"Add Aromatics: Add the minced garlic and ginger to the wok and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
9,"Pour in the Soy Sauce Mixture: Pour in the remaining soy sauce mixture from the chicken coating and bring to a simmer."
10,"Season with Sichuan Peppercorns: Add the ground Sichuan peppercorns and simmer for an additional minute, allowing the flavors to infuse."
11,"Return the Chicken: Add the fried chicken back to the wok with the simmering sauce. Toss gently to coat the chicken in the sauce."
12,"Heat Through and Thicken: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the chicken."
13,"Serve: Garnish with chopped scallions (reserve some for garnish) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Szechuan chicken, with a numbing and spicy kick!"
