1,"Cooking the Corn: You can cook the corn on the cob using your preferred method. Here are three options:"
1a,"Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the corn directly on the grill and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the kernels are tender and lightly charred in spots."
1b,"Boiling: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until tender. Drain the water."
1c,"Microwaving: Wrap each ear of corn in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes, turning halfway through. Be careful, the corn will be hot!"
2,"Optional Step: Brush the cooked corn with melted butter for extra flavor (if using)."
3,"In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and Mexican crema (or sour cream) to create a creamy sauce. Season the sauce with a pinch of salt to taste."
4,"Spread the creamy sauce evenly over the cooked corn cobs."
5,"Sprinkle the crumbled Cotija cheese (or Queso Fresco cheese if using) generously over the corn."
6,"Dust the corn with chili powder (or ancho chili powder if using) according to your desired spice level. You can start with a little and add more to taste."
7,"Finely chop the cilantro and sprinkle it over the corn."
8,"Squeeze fresh lime juice from the wedges over each corn cob to taste."
9,"Serve Elote immediately while hot, with lime wedges on the side for extra acidity."
