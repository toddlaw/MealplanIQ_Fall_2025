1,"In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the chicken broth with the cornstarch until smooth. Set aside."
2,"In a large saucepan or pot, bring the remaining chicken broth (3.5 cups) to a simmer over medium heat."
3,"Optional: Add a few drops of vegetable oil to the simmering broth to help prevent sticking."
4,"Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry back into the simmering broth. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the broth thickens slightly."
5,"Season the broth with soy sauce, salt, and white pepper to taste. Be careful not to oversalt, as you can adjust the seasoning later."
6,"In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs together until well beaten."
7,"Here comes the trick for creating the egg ribbons: Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the simmering broth in a thin stream while constantly stirring the broth in a circular motion with a fork or whisk. This will create delicate egg ribbons throughout the soup."
8,"Continue stirring for another minute or two, or until the egg ribbons are cooked through and the soup is heated to your desired temperature."
9,"Optional: Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped fresh chives for a pop of color and freshness."
10,"Serve the egg drop soup hot in bowls. Enjoy!"
