Step,Instruction
1,"Optional Step: Roast the Poblano Pepper (if using)."
1a,"Roast the poblano pepper directly over a gas stove burner or under a broiler until blackened on all sides." 
1b,"Once blackened, place the pepper in a paper bag and seal it shut. Let it steam for 10 minutes. This loosens the skin."
1c,"After steaming, peel off the blackened skin, remove the stem and seeds, and dice the pepper flesh."
2,"Optional Step: Cook the Chorizo (if using)"
2a,"Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the chorizo sausage and cook until browned and crumbled, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks. Drain any excess grease."
3,"In a large oven-safe skillet or cast iron pan, heat the neutral oil over medium heat. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Add the shredded Mexican melting cheese (Oaxaca or Quesadilla) and Monterey Jack cheese to the pan. You can adjust the cheese ratio depending on your preference."  
5,"Optional Step Add the diced roasted poblano pepper (if using) and cooked crumbled chorizo (if using) on top of the cheese."
6,"Pour the milk around the edges of the pan, not directly over the cheese. This helps prevent the cheese from burning."
7,"Cooking Methods:** Choose one of the following methods to melt the cheese:"
7a,"Stovetop Method:** Cook the cheese mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is melted and gooey. This method may take 5-7 minutes, depending on the heat and the type of pan used."
7b,"Oven Method (recommended):** Preheat your oven to broil. Broil the cheese mixture for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly on top. Keep a close eye on the cheese under the broiler to prevent burning."
8,"Optional Step: Once the cheese is melted, remove the pan from the heat (if using the stovetop method) and sprinkle with chopped green onion for garnish."
9,"Serve Queso Fundido immediately while hot, with warm flour tortillas or bread for scooping."
10,"Enjoy this delicious melted cheese dip as an appetizer or a light meal!"
