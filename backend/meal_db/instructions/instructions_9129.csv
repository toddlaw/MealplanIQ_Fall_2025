Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish."
2,"Bring the milk to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the rice and salt to the milk, then lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until the rice is tender, approximately 18 minutes."
3,"Gradually add the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the rice, stirring constantly to prevent curdling. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes until thickened, stirring continuously."
4,"Take in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top is lightly golden and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean."
5,"In a glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until soft peaks begin to form. Slowly add 3 tablespoons of sugar while continuing to beat until stiff peaks are achieved. When you lift the beater or whisk straight up, the egg whites should form sharp peaks. Carefully spread the egg white mixture over the rice mixture, making sure the egg whites reach the edges of the casserole dish."
6,"Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes."
