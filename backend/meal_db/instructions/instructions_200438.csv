1,"Marinate the Shrimp: In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the shrimp marinate for 15 minutes for extra flavor (optional)."
2,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, chicken broth, water, honey, rice vinegar, and white pepper. Set aside."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Sear the Shrimp: Add the marinated shrimp to the hot wok and spread them out in a single layer. Sear the shrimp for 1-2 minutes per side, or until pink and cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the wok and set aside on a plate."
5,"Steam the Broccoli: While the shrimp cooks, steam the broccoli florets for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. You can use a steamer basket over boiling water or a microwave steamer."
6,"Stir-fry the Garlic and Ginger: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
7,"Pour in the Sauce: Add the prepared sauce mixture to the wok and bring to a simmer over medium heat."
8,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together an additional 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
9,"Return the Shrimp and Broccoli: Add the cooked shrimp and steamed broccoli florets back to the wok with the simmering sauce."
10,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the shrimp and broccoli in the sauce."
11,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the ingredients."
12,"Serve: Turn off the heat and transfer the Chinese-style shrimp with broccoli to a serving platter. Enjoy your delicious and healthy dish!"
