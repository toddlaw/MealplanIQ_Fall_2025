Step,Instruction
A,"Marinate the Protein (if using skirt steak or chicken)"
1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, lime juice, 1 tablespoon canola oil, garlic cloves, chili powder, cumin, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper (optional) to create a marinade."
2,"Place the skirt steak (trimmed of excess fat) or chicken breasts in the marinade."
3,"Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours for deeper flavor."
B,"Prepare the Toppings"
4,"Dice the red or white onion."
5,"Chop the cilantro leaves"
6,"Cut the limes into wedges."
7,"Prepare any other desired toppings like diced tomato, sliced avocado, crumbled cheese, salsa, or guacamole."
C,"Cook the Protein"
8,"Skirt Steak: Heat a grill pan or cast iron skillet over high heat. Sear the marinated skirt steak for 2-3 minutes per side for medium-rare, or to your desired doneness. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain."
9,"Chicken Breast: You can grill, pan-fry, bake, or poach the chicken breasts according to your preference. Once cooked through, shred or slice the chicken."
10,"Ground Beef: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spatula, until browned. Drain any excess grease."
D,"Heat tortillas (optional)"
11,"You can warm the tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few seconds per side."
12,"Alternatively, you can fry them in a shallow layer of hot vegetable oil for 30-60 seconds per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil."
E,"Assemble the Tacos"
13,"Warm the tortillas (if not already done)."
14,"Add a layer of protein (skirt steak, chicken, or ground beef) to each tortilla."
15,"Top with chopped onion, cilantro, and your desired toppings (diced tomato, sliced avocado, cheese, salsa, guacamole, etc.)."
F,"Serve Mexican Street Tacos immediately while hot"
16,"Squeeze fresh lime wedges over each taco for extra citrus flavor. Enjoy!"
