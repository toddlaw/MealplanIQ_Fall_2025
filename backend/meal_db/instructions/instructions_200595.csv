Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat a cast-iron skillet or a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. A cast-iron skillet will help achieve crispy potatoes."
2,"Peel the potatoes and slice them into rounds about 1/8 inch thick. You can use a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife for even slices."
3,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the potato slices for 2-3 minutes. This step helps to remove some starch and can lead to crispier potatoes (optional). Drain the potatoes well and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process."
4,"Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the preheated skillet. If using, add 2 tablespoons of butter as well. Let the oil and butter heat up until shimmering."
5,"Add the sliced onions to the hot oil/butter mixture. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the onions for 10-15 minutes, or until softened and caramelized, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat to medium-low if needed to prevent burning."
6,Optional Step (For a Garlicky Version): While the onions are caramelizing, in a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Add the cooked garlic to the pan with the caramelized onions."
7,"Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the parboiled or sliced potatoes (drained well) to the pan with the caramelized onions (and garlic, if using). Spread the potatoes in a single layer as much as possible."
8,"Optional Step (For a Crusty Bottom): Don't stir the potatoes too much during the first few minutes of cooking. This allows the bottoms to brown and become crispy."
9,"Cook the potatoes for 10-15 minutes per side, or until golden brown and tender on the inside. You may need to adjust the heat slightly to ensure even cooking without burning."
10,"Optional Step (Deglazing the Pan for Extra Flavor): Once the potatoes are almost cooked through, you can add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to the pan. Carefully scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the vinegar deglazes. Let the vinegar simmer for a minute or two, allowing some of the liquid to evaporate."
11,"Optional Step (For a Richer Flavor): If using, pour in 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Let the mixture simmer for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to slightly thicken."
12,"Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve hot. Enjoy the Lyonnaise potatoes as a delicious side dish!"
