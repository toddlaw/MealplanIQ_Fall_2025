1,"Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and sauté until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes."
2,"Place the wine in a shallow dish or bowl. Dip each piece of chicken into the wine individually and then return them to the skillet. Pour in any leftover wine, stock, and onions, mix well, and lower the heat to medium."
3,"Cover the skillet and cook for 30 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink in the center. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and water, then add this mixture to the sauce to thicken it; cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes and serve."
