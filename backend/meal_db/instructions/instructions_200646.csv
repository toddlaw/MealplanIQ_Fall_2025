1,"Wash and trim the ends of the cucumber. Using a julienne peeler or mandoline, slice the cucumber into thin julienne strips. Alternatively, you can thinly slice the cucumber by hand."
2,"Place the sliced cucumber in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Toss gently to coat evenly. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to allow the salt to draw out excess moisture from the cucumber."
3,"Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together sugar, gochugaru, minced garlic, fish sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar. Adjust the amount of gochugaru depending on your desired spice level."
4,"After 10-15 minutes, drain the cucumber in a colander, rinsing briefly under cold running water to remove some of the salt. Squeeze out any excess moisture with your hands or a clean kitchen towel."
5,"Transfer the drained cucumber back to the large bowl."
6,"Pour the prepared sauce over the cucumber and toss gently to ensure all the cucumber pieces are evenly coated."
7,"Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You can add a pinch more sugar for additional sweetness or a touch more fish sauce for a stronger savory flavor."
8,"Garnish with sliced scallions and sesame seeds."
9,"Serve Oi Muchim immediately at room temperature or slightly chilled as a side dish with Korean meals."
