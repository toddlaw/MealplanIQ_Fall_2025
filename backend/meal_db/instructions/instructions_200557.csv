1,"Place a large pot of salted water over high heat and bring to a boil. Peel the russet potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes for even cooking."

3,"While the potatoes are cooking, heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter is melted and the milk is hot. Do not boil the milk."
4,"In a large bowl, mash the cooked potatoes with a potato masher or a hand mixer until mostly smooth, leaving a few small chunks for texture."
