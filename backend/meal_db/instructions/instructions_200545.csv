1,"In a large pot, combine pork shoulder, water, garlic cloves, oregano, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer partially covered for 2-2.5 hours, or until the pork is very tender and falling off the bone."
2,"While the pork simmers, prepare the dried chiles. If using whole dried chiles, remove the stems and seeds. You can wear gloves to avoid chili burn on your hands. Rinse the chiles briefly under warm water to remove any dust. In a small saucepan, cover the chiles with boiling water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or until softened."
3,"Once softened, transfer the soaked chiles to a blender with about 1 cup of the soaking liquid. Blend until you have a smooth sauce. You can strain the sauce for a finer consistency, but some pulp is okay."
4,"In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
5,"Pour the blended chile sauce into the pan with the onions. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring frequently, to allow the flavors to meld."
6,"Strain the cooked pork and broth from the pot into a large bowl. Discard the bay leaves. Shred the cooked pork with two forks and return it to the pot with the broth."
7,"Add the cooked chile sauce from the pan to the pot with the pork and broth. Stir to combine."
8,"If using canned hominy, rinse and drain it well before adding it to the pot. If using dried hominy, follow package instructions for pre-soaking and cooking. Add the hominy to the pot with the pork and broth."
9,"Bring the pozole to a simmer and cook for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the hominy is heated through and the flavors have come together. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."
10,"Serve the pozole hot in bowls.  Offer a variety of garnishes on the side, such as sliced radishes, shredded cabbage, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, sliced avocado, and toasted pumpkin seeds. Let everyone enjoy their pozole customized with their favorite toppings!"
