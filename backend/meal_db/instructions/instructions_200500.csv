Part A,"For the Vegetable Broth"
1,"Make the dashi: In a large pot, combine the vegetable broth, soaked shiitake mushrooms (reserve soaking liquid), kombu seaweed, smashed garlic, and sliced ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, then remove and discard the kombu seaweed. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the shiitake mushrooms and any solids."
2,"Season the broth: Add the soy sauce, mirin, and sake (if using) to the strained broth. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld."
Part B,"Marinate the Tofu (optional)"
3,"Marinate the tofu (optional): In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake (if using), and maple syrup. Toss the cubed tofu in the marinade and let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight, for deeper flavor."
Part C,"Assemble the Ramen"
4,"Bake the tofu (optional): Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Arrange the marinated tofu cubes on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy on the edges."
5,"Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse briefly with hot water."
6,"Heat the broth: Bring the seasoned vegetable broth back to a simmer over medium heat."
7,"Blanch the vegetables: In a separate pot of boiling water, blanch the baby bok choy halves for 1-2 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Drain and set aside."
8,"Sauté the wood ear mushrooms (optional): Heat a small amount of oil in a pan and sauté the sliced wood ear mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Set aside."
Part D,"Assemble the Bowls"
9,"Divide the cooked ramen noodles between two serving bowls. Top each bowl with baked tofu cubes (if using), ajitsuke tamago halves (if using), a sheet of nori seaweed, and blanched baby bok choy halves."
10,"Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and toppings."
11,"Garnish (optional): Garnish with sliced green onions, sautéed wood ear mushrooms (if using), corn, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds."
12,"Serve: Enjoy your vegetarian ramen hot and flavorful!"
Part E,"Notes"
1,"Marinating the tofu adds extra flavor, but you can skip this step and simply pan-fry the cubed tofu until golden brown."
2,"You can adjust the amount of soy sauce, mirin, and sake in the broth to your taste preference for a saltier or lighter flavored ramen."
