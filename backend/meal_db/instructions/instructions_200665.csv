Step,Instruction
1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the masa harina and salt. If using vegetable shortening, cut it into small pieces and rub it into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until crumbly."
2,"Optional Step: You can substitute olive oil for vegetable shortening. If using olive oil, add it to the dry ingredients and stir to combine."
3,"Gradually add the warm water, a little at a time, while mixing with a dough whisk or your hand. Continue adding water until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. You may not need all the water, depending on the brand of masa harina."
4,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Add a bit more flour if the dough feels too sticky."
5,"Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 15 minutes at room temperature."
6,"Divide the dough into 16 equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle using a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch."
7,"Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. You can test the heat by flicking a few drops of water onto the surface. If the water sizzles and evaporates quickly, the pan is hot enough."
8,"Cook each tortilla for about 30-45 seconds per side, or until lightly golden brown on both sides. You may see small brown spots appear on the surface â€“ this is normal."
9,"Wrap the cooked tortillas in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft until serving."
10,"Enjoy corn tortillas warm with your favorite fillings, such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or fajitas."
