Step,Instruction
A,"Make the Tart Crust"
1,"Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, powdered sugar, and salt."
2,"Cut in butter: Cut in cold butter using a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs."
3,"Add liquid ingredients: In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk and vinegar. Add to dry ingredients and mix until just combined."
4,"Form dough: Gather dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes."
5,"Roll and fit: On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim edges, crimp, and refrigerate for 30 minutes."
6,"Blind bake: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line crust with parchment paper and pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove weights and parchment, bake for another 5-7 minutes, or until lightly golden."
B,"Make the Custard Filling"
7,"Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar and cornstarch."
8,"Combine wet ingredients: In a saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, milk, and heavy cream. Gradually whisk in dry ingredients."
9,"Cook custard: Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla zest."
10,"Strain and cool: Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely cooled."

12,"Arrange fruit: Arrange your chosen fresh fruit attractively on top of the custard."
13,"Glaze fruit (optional): Heat apricot or peach jam until slightly runny. Brush lightly over the fruit for a glaze."
