Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Hijiki Seaweed"
1,"Soak the Hijiki: In a large bowl, rinse the dried hijiki seaweed under cold running water to remove any debris. Cover the seaweed with 4 cups of cold water and let it soak for at least 30 minutes, or until softened and rehydrated."
2,"Drain and Rinse: Once rehydrated, drain the hijiki seaweed thoroughly in a colander. Rinse it again under cold running water to remove any excess salt."
B,"Prepare the Vegetables"
3,"Julienne the Carrot: Julienne the carrot into thin matchsticks or shred it using a grater." 
4,"Optional Slicing: If using shiitake mushrooms, thinly slice them."
5,"Prepare Aburage (optional): Slice the aburage (fried tofu pockets) into thin strips."
C,"Cook the Vegetables"
6,"Heat Oil in a Pan: Heat the sesame oil in a medium pan over medium heat."
7,"Sauté Carrot and Optional Mushrooms: Add the julienned carrot (and sliced shiitake mushrooms, if using) to the pan and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the carrots begin to soften slightly."
8,"Add Aburage (optional): Add the sliced aburage (fried tofu pockets) to the pan and cook for an additional minute."
D,"Combine and Simmer"
9,"Add Hijiki and Dashi: Add the drained and rinsed hijiki seaweed and the dashi stock (or water) to the pan. Stir to combine."
10,"Season and Simmer:  Add the soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (if using). Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid has mostly reduced and the hijiki is tender."
E,"Finishing Touches and Serve:"
11,"Stir in Edamame:  Stir in the shelled edamame (frozen or fresh) and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until heated through."
12,"Season and Garnish:  Taste the salad and adjust seasonings with additional soy sauce or mirin (if using) to your preference. Remove the pan from heat and stir in the toasted sesame seeds."
13,"Serve Warm or Cold: Serve the hijiki salad warm or at room temperature. Garnish with additional toasted sesame seeds and shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice powder) for a touch of heat (optional). Enjoy!"
F,"Tips:"
1,"You can adjust the soaking time for the hijiki seaweed depending on the thickness. Thicker hijiki may require a longer soaking time."
2,"Leftover hijiki salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavor and texture may change slightly over time."
