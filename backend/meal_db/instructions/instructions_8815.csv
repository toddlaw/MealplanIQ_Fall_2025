1,"In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, milk, and eggs. Use a hand beater to mix everything together until smooth."
2,"Make Yorkshire pudding 30 minutes before the roast finishes. Take the roast out of the oven and pour the drippings into a 9x9 inch pan until there is 1/2 cup. Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and put the roast back in the oven. Pour the pudding batter into the pan with the drippings and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes."
3,"Once the roast is removed from the oven, continue baking the pudding for an additional 25 to 30 minutes. Allow it to cool, cut into squares, and serve alongside the roast."
