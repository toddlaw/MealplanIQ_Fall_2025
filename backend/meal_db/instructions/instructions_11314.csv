Step,Instruction
1,"Knead the dough in a large bowl; combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 cup of sugar. Blend in margarine until pea-sized lumps form. Create a well in the center, and add eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Mix together until a dough forms, then knead briefly on a floured surface."
2,"Cut out the dough with a 3-inch cookie cutter or a drinking glass, creating about 20 circles. Grease two 12-cup muffin tins or tart pans. Line the muffin cups with the dough, reserving some for the tops."
3,"Whisk together cornstarch and 3/4 cup sugar in the top of a double boiler or a metal bowl set atop a saucepan of simmering water. Gradually whisk in 3 egg yolks and 1 quart milk, stirring constantly until thick and bubbling. Remove from heat, and stir in butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla until butter is melted."
4,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spoon the vanilla cream halfway into the pastry shells. Roll out the remaining dough and cut into circles for the lids. Cover the pastry shells with the circles and press the edges firmly with a fork. Whisk the remaining egg yolk with a fork and brush it over the tops of the pastry cups.
5,"Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow the pastries to cool in the tins before gently loosening the edges for removal. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving."
