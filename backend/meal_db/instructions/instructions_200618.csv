1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleanup.

2. **Prepare the Mushrooms:** Wipe clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully remove the stems from the mushroom caps, twisting and pulling them out.  **Tip:** Reserve the stems for another recipe (like making mushroom stock).

3. **Sauté the Aromatics:** In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.

4. **Wilt the Spinach:** Add the chopped spinach to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted and any excess moisture has evaporated. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

5. **Combine the Filling:** In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked spinach mixture with ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, and chopped fresh parsley. Season with additional salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  **Optional:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a bit of spice.

6. **Stuff the Mushrooms:** Divide the filling mixture evenly among the mushroom caps. Gently press the stuffing down to fill the cavity.  **Optional:** Sprinkle the tops of the stuffed mushrooms with breadcrumbs for a crispier topping.

7. **Bake:** Transfer the stuffed mushrooms to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is golden brown and bubbly.

8. **Serve and Enjoy:** Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the stuffed mushrooms cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them hot as a delicious appetizer, side dish, or even a vegetarian main course.
