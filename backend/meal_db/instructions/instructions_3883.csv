1,"Butter an 8-inch baking dish or pie pan and set it aside. In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of water and cornstarch, mixing until smooth; set aside."
2,"Combine the coconut milk, 3/4 cup of water, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then add the corn kernels and quickly stir in the cornstarch mixture, mixing rapidly to prevent lumps as it thickens. Return to a boil and simmer, stirring constantly, until fully thickened and smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour the maja blanca into the prepared dish and let it cool until firm, approximately 2 hours."
3,"Add the coconut flakes to a dry skillet over medium heat and stir to toast them, being careful not to let them burn. Once toasted, transfer the coconut flakes to a bowl, allow them to cool, and then sprinkle over the pudding just before serving."
