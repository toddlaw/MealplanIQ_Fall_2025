1,"Marinate the Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, and a pinch of salt. Let the chicken marinate for 15 minutes for extra tenderness (optional)."
2,"Prepare the Coating: In one shallow dish, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. In another shallow dish, whisk together the beaten eggs."
3,"Prepare the Dredging Station: Set up a third shallow dish with the all-purpose flour. Dredge each piece of marinated chicken in the cornstarch mixture, then coat it in the beaten egg, and finally, coat it in the flour. Shake off any excess flour."
4,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
5,"Fry the Chicken: Carefully add the chicken pieces, a few at a time, to the hot oil to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature)."
6,"Drain the Chicken: Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
7,"Prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce: In a separate wok or skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
8,"Add Reserved Pineapple Juice: Pour in the reserved pineapple juice from the canned pineapple chunks. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld."
9,"Incorporate Sauces and Seasonings: Add the ketchup, sugar, rice vinegar, water, soy sauce, and a pinch of white pepper to the simmering sauce. Stir well to combine and bring to a slight boil."
10,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl to create a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
11,"Add Vegetables and Pineapple: Add the sliced red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion, and drained pineapple chunks to the wok with the simmering sauce."
12,"Heat Through: Stir-fry for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly softened and heated through."
13,"Return the Chicken: Add the fried chicken back to the wok with the sweet and sour sauce and vegetables."
14,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything gently to combine and coat the chicken in the sauce."
15,"Serve Immediately: Turn off the heat and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Chinese-style sweet and sour chicken!"
