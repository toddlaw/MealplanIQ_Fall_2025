1,"Marinate the Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the chicken marinate for 15 minutes for extra tenderness (optional)."
2,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, chicken broth, water, oyster sauce (if using), honey, rice vinegar, and white pepper. Set aside."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
4,"Sear the Chicken: Add the marinated chicken to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (depending on the thickness of the chicken pieces)."
5,"Remove the Chicken: Once cooked, transfer the seared chicken to a plate and set aside."
6,"Steam the Broccoli: While the chicken cooks, steam the broccoli florets for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. You can use a steamer basket over boiling water or a microwave steamer."
7,"Stir-fry the Garlic and Ginger: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
8,"Pour in the Sauce: Add the prepared sauce mixture to the wok and bring to a simmer over medium heat."
9,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together an additional 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
10,"Return the Chicken and Broccoli: Add the cooked chicken and steamed broccoli florets back to the wok with the simmering sauce."
11,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the chicken and broccoli in the sauce."
12,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the ingredients."
13,"Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil (optional) for extra flavor. Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Chinese-style chicken and broccoli!"
