1,"Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned on all sides."
2,"Drain any excess fat from the browned beef using a colander or slotted spoon."
3,"Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery to the pot with the cooked beef. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and translucent."
4,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
5,"Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, allowing the tomato paste to caramelize slightly."
6,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, red wine (if using), beef broth, and milk (if using). Season with bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper (to taste)."
7,"Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot slightly, and simmer for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer the sauce, the richer and deeper the flavor will be."
8,"While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes)."
9,"Optional: Reserve about Â½ cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta completely. This starchy water can help loosen up the sauce if it becomes too thick."
10,"Once the sauce is finished simmering and the pasta is cooked, remove the bay leaf from the sauce."
11,"Drain the pasta and toss it with the Bolognese sauce in a large bowl or directly in the pot. Add a little bit of the reserved pasta water (if needed) to help create a smooth and saucy consistency."
12,"Serve the Spaghetti Bolognese immediately in warmed bowls. Top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (to taste) and enjoy!"
