1,"Cut napa cabbage into quarters or wedges. Remove the tough core."
2,"In a large bowl, toss cabbage with kosher salt. Ensure all leaves are coated. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 6-8 hours, or until wilted and softened."
3,"Rinse cabbage thoroughly under cold running water until most of the salt is removed. Squeeze out excess water and transfer cabbage to a colander. Let drain for 30 minutes."
4,"Meanwhile, prepare the kimchi paste. In a large bowl, combine Korean red pepper flakes, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Stir into a smooth paste."
5,"Add julienned radish and scallions to the kimchi paste. Mix well."
6,"Once cabbage has drained, gently massage the kimchi paste mixture between the cabbage leaves, ensuring even distribution."
7,"Optional: In a small saucepan, whisk together glutinous rice flour with a little water to make a thin slurry. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes translucent. Let cool slightly before adding to the kimchi mixture (this step helps accelerate fermentation)."
8,"Transfer the kimchi mixture to a non-reactive container (glass jar or ceramic crock preferred). Press down firmly to remove air pockets and ensure all vegetables are submerged in the brine."
9,"Leave a couple of inches of headspace in the jar. If needed, add water to cover the vegetables completely."
10,"Loosely cover the jar with a lid or cheesecloth. Let kimchi ferment at room temperature (around 68Â°F) for 1-3 days, depending on your desired level of spiciness and sourness. Taste daily to monitor fermentation progress."
11,"Once kimchi reaches your desired taste, transfer the jar to the refrigerator. Kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the cold, and flavors will continue to develop. Kimchi is best enjoyed after at least a few days of refrigeration."
12,"Store kimchi in the refrigerator for up to several weeks. Serve cold alongside Korean meals or enjoy on its own."
