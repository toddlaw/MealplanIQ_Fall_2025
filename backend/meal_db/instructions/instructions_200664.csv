1,"Wash and dry the roma tomatoes. Seed the tomatoes and dice them into small pieces. You can adjust the size of the dice depending on your preference for a chunkier or finer salsa."
2,"Finely dice the red onion. Aim for similar-sized pieces as the diced tomatoes."
3,"Optional Step: If using a jalapeño pepper for a kick of spice, remove the seeds and finely dice it. Be careful when handling jalapeños and wear gloves if you have sensitive skin."
4,"In a medium bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, red onion, and jalapeño pepper (if using)."
5,"Squeeze the lime juice into the bowl and stir to coat the ingredients evenly. The lime juice adds brightness and helps prevent browning."
6,"Finely chop the cilantro and add it to the bowl. Stir everything together to combine."
7,"Season the salsa with salt and a pinch of black pepper (optional) to taste. You can adjust the amount of seasonings to your preference."
8,"Optional Step: Mince a small garlic clove and add it to the salsa for an extra layer of flavor."
9,"**Optional Step: Dice half of an avocado for a creamier salsa. Gently fold the diced avocado into the salsa to avoid mashing it."
10,"Optional Step: Seed and dice a quarter of a cucumber for a refreshing twist.  Gently fold the diced cucumber into the salsa." 
11,"Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the salsa to an airtight container. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Chilling also helps the salsa become slightly less watery."
12,"Serve Salsa Fresca cold with tortilla chips, veggie sticks, or as a topping for tacos, burritos, or grilled meats."
