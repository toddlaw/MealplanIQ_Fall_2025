1,"In a saucepan over medium heat, combine milk and salt. Mix 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour and water in a small bowl. Once the milk starts to bubble, add the flour mixture and cook until thickened, about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Cool until set, or refrigerate for quicker setting."
2,"In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, and corn oil. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in the buttermilk mixture. Add the raisins, and stir a few times, just until the ingredients come together into a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and with floured hands shape dough into a ball. Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet, and cut a large cross in the top with a sharp knife."
