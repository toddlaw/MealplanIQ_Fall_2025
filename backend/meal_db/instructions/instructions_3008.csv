1,"In a big bowl, add the flour and slowly incorporate the water. Stir until the dough takes shape; knead until the dough is smooth, which should take around 15 to 20 minutes."
2,"Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow it to sit undisturbed for 15 minutes."
3,"Take the dough and knead once more for a couple of minutes; then give it a rest, covering it again for another quarter of an hour."
4,"Knead the dough once again for a couple of minutes. Then, segment it into four equal sections.
5,"Use a rolling pin to roll out each of these sections into sheets that are approximately 3/8-inch in thickness. Apply a coating of oil to both sides of all the sheets."
6,"Layer the sheets one on top of the other, seal them inside a plastic wrap, and allow them to settle for about a quarter of an hour."
7,"Bring a considerable amount of water to a rolling boil in a sizable saucepan.""
8,"Put one dough sheet on a chopping board and cut into strips about 1/8-inch wide. Hold the ends of a strip and extend it till it's about 30 to 35 inches long.
9,"Fold it into three sections and stretch again to the initial length; a few shakes and slaps on the counter will extend it to 2 to 3 yards. Drop this noodle into the boiling water."
10,"Add two or three more stretched noodles into the boiling water and let them cook until they are tender, which should take about 5 to 10 minutes. Shift the boiled noodles into a dish after draining the water."
11,"Carry on with the same process for the remaining dough sheets."
12,"Warning: This recipe is challenging to execute. It demands a considerable amount of experience as you need to be familiar with the dough's texture at each critical phase of the noodle creation process."
