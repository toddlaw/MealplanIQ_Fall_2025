1,"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)."
2,"In a medium bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Shape the crumbs into a ball and knead by hand until smooth. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an 8-inch circle. Transfer the circle to a baking sheet and cut it into 16 wedges, keeping the circle whole."
3,"Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center is firm. Cut the circle into wedges again while still warm, and move to a wire rack to cool."
