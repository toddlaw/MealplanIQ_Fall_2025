1,"Prepare the pork: Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound the pork chops gently until they are about 1/4 inch thick."
2,"Season the pork: Season both sides of the pork chops with salt and black pepper."
3,"Set up the breading station: Prepare three shallow bowls. In the first bowl, add the flour. In the second bowl, whisk the eggs. In the third bowl, add the panko breadcrumbs."
4,"Bread the pork: Dredge each pork chop in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the floured pork chop in the egg wash, letting any excess drip off. Finally, coat the pork chop generously in the panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere."
5,"Heat the oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of about 2 inches to 350°F."
6,"Fry the tonkatsu: Carefully lower the breaded pork chops into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature of the pork should reach 145°F."
7,"Drain and rest: Transfer the fried tonkatsu to a wire rack set over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Let them rest for a few minutes before slicing."
8,"Serve: Slice the tonkatsu into thin strips and serve immediately with tonkatsu sauce for dipping, shredded cabbage, and steamed rice (optional)."
