1,"In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in shortening using your hands or a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. If it appears more floury than crumbly, add one or two more tablespoons of shortening. Slowly add about 3/4 cup of hot water, or just enough to moisten the mixture."
2,"Knead the dough by hand or use a large fork, pressing it against the sides of the mixing bowl to collect any dough that sticks. If the dough remains sticky, incorporate a few additional tablespoons of flour until it takes on a soft, round shape. For optimal results, cover the dough with a clean dish towel and allow it to rest for approximately an hour."
3,"Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each rolled-out dough piece until it starts to bubble and develops light brown spots, about 1 minute per side."
4,"Cook each rolled dough in the hot skillet for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until golden brown."
5,"Place a tortilla in the heated pan and cook until it is brown and slightly puffy, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Flip the tortilla to brown the other side for about 30 seconds to a minute more, then transfer to a plate. Repeat the process with each piece of dough. Keep the cooked tortillas covered with a towel to maintain warmth and moisture until serving."
