1,"Warm the olive oil in a sizable pot on medium heat. Incorporate the garlic, tomatoes, bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper. Sprinkle with paprika, black pepper, and sea salt. Saute occasionally for 20 minutes until vegetables soften. Lower the heat, shield with a lid and let it simmer until the liquid disappears and the salad condenses, approximately an additional 2 hours. Mix in the lemon juice, and put it in the fridge overnight prior to serving."
