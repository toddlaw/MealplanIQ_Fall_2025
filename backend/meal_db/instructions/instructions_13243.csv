Step,Instruction
1,Put the pork chops between two heavy plastic sheets on a level surface. Use the smooth side of a meat mallet to pound the pork to a 1/2-inch thickness.
2,"In a large mixing bowl, mix together crackers, Greek seasoning, and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Coat the pork chops in flour, then dip them in egg before coating them in the cracker mixture one at a time."
3,"In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Cook pork chops in the butter until golden brown, adjusting heat if needed, about 10 to 15 minutes each side or until cooked through. Serve with lemon wedges."
4,The nutritional information provided for this recipe accounts for the full quantity of the breading ingredients and butter used. Actual consumption amounts may differ.
5,"Leaving the pork chops slightly thicker than the usual schnitzel recipe can make them more juicy. Coating them with crumbs in a large bowl ensures even coverage, with a light, even coating preferred. Using buttery crackers instead of Saltines creates a moister consistency akin to traditional bread crumbs. Optimal cooking involves medium-low heat in a thick nonstick skillet for a well-browned crust. The recommended butter amount provides the best results, emphasizing flavor over low fat content. Salt should be used sparingly to avoid oversalting from the crackers."
