1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the almonds on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are lightly browned or start to emit a fragrant aroma. Take them out of the oven and let them cool completely. Grind the almonds in a food processor or blender until they reach a texture similar to coarse sand. Make sure the almonds are cool, as hot almonds will turn into almond butter."
2,"In a medium bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg, then mix in the almond extract and milk. Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt, and combine with the ground toasted almonds to create a soft dough. Chill the dough for 15 to 20 minutes to help the cookies maintain their shape when pressed."
3,"Lightly grease the cookie sheets and load the cookie press with dough. Press out cookies, ensuring they are at least 1 inch apart, depending on their size. Feel free to try out different cookie designs; while many Swedes prefer the star shape, you are welcome to choose any shape you like."
4,"Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned. Let them cool on the cookie sheets for a minute before moving to a wire rack to cool completely."
