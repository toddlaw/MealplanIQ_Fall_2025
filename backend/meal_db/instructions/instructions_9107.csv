1,"In a large bowl, whisk the eggs together; then add the milk, flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, mixing until the batter is very thin."
2,"Heat a griddle or Swedish plett pan over medium heat; drizzle in approximately 1 teaspoon of oil. Pour a small amount of batter onto the griddle and tilt it to spread the batter into a thin layer; cook until lightly browned for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until the other side is browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Roll the pancake and transfer it to a plate. Continue with the rest of the batter."
