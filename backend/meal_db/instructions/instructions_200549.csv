Part A,"Make the Tostada Shells"
1,"Frying Method: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat to a depth of about 1/4 inch. The oil should be shimmering hot but not smoking."
2,"Carefully place one corn tortilla at a time into the hot oil. Fry for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain the fried tortillas on paper towels to remove excess oil."
3,"Baking Method: Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange the corn tortillas in a single layer on the baking sheet."
4,"Bake for 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. You can flip the tortillas halfway through baking for even browning."
Part B,"Assemble the Tostadas"
5,"Spread a layer of refried beans on each tostada shell (optional)."
6,"Add your desired protein toppings like shredded chicken, shredded beef, or both."
7,"Top with shredded cheese, chopped lettuce, diced tomato, and chopped red onion."
8,"Add any other desired toppings like sliced avocado, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, chopped cilantro, pickled jalapenos, and lime wedges."
9,"Serve immediately and enjoy your custom-made tostadas!"
