1,"Marinate the beef: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, gochujang (start with 1 tablespoon and adjust to your spice preference), minced garlic, grated ginger, grated pear, sliced onion, sesame oil, and black pepper. Whisk well to dissolve the sugar and brown sugar."

2,"Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to overnight for deeper flavor."

3,"Cook the bulgogi: Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated beef along with some of the marinade. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through to your desired doneness."

4,"Garnish and serve: Transfer the cooked bulgogi to a plate. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and sesame seeds (optional). Serve hot with rice and your favorite banchan (Korean side dishes)."

**Notes:**

* Marinating the beef for a longer time allows the flavors to develop further.
* If the marinade starts to burn while cooking, add a splash of water or low-sodium broth to deglaze the pan.
* You can adjust the amount of gochujang for your desired level of spiciness.
* Bulgogi can be served with various side dishes like kimchi, pickled vegetables, or Korean pancakes.
