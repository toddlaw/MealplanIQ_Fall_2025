1,"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium saucepan, mix shortening, salt, and boiling water, heating the mixture until it reaches a full boil. Lower the heat, incorporate the flour all at once, and stir vigorously until a ball forms. Take it off the heat, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Keep beating until the mixture is thick, shiny, and pulls away from the spoon."
