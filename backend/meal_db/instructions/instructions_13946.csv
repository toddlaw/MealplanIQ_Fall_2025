12,"I have found that leaving them a little thicker than the usual schnitzel makes them juicier. Tossing in the crumbs gives the most even coverage on the chops. The coating should be only a light, even crumb coating. You can use Saltine crackers for this recipe, but the buttery, richer tasting crackers' crumb consistency is more moist like the traditional breadcrumbs used for schnitzel. Also, if you don't use a thick nonstick skillet, you may need to start on medium-low heat and stay on medium-low throughout the cooking process, but the schnitzel browns much better and comes out with a better crust. The key to these is not to cook too fast or too high. I have also experimented with the amount of butter used in this recipe, and this amount does yield the best results. This is definitely not a recipe if you are worried about the butter content of it. Adding salt instead of a seasoning mix due to the crackers makes the coating too salty, and a seasoning mix at the end adds more flavor."
