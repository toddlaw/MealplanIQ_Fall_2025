1,"Peel the white onion. Depending on your preference, you can chop the onion finely (for a milder flavor) or more roughly (for a stronger onion flavor).  Here are two methods for chopping the onion:"
1a,"Dice the Onion: Cut the onion in half from root to tip. Place the cut side down on the cutting board. Make thin vertical slices through the onion, stopping just before the root end. Then, make thin horizontal slices across the onion, chopping through the vertical slices to create small cubes."
1b,"Mince the Onion:  Finely chop the onion by making multiple thin slices through the root end, then chop the slices again until very finely diced."
2,"Chop the Cilantro: Wash and dry the cilantro leaves. Discard the thick stems and chop the leaves to your desired size."
3,"Combine the chopped onion and chopped cilantro in a small bowl."
4,"Optional Step:** Squeeze fresh lime juice from the lime wedges over the mixture, to taste. Lime juice adds a tangy and refreshing flavor."
5,"Season with salt to taste. Start with a small amount and add more gradually as desired."
6,"Serve Chopped Onion and Cilantro (Cebolla y Cilantro Picado) immediately as a garnish for tacos, burritos, tostadas, or other Mexican dishes."
