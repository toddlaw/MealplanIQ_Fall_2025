1,"Rinse the dried black soybeans thoroughly in cold water. Pick out any discolored beans or debris."
2,"In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the rinsed soybeans and water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat."
3,"Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the soybeans are tender but still retain a slight chew. You may need to add more water during simmering if the water level gets too low."
4,"While the soybeans simmer, prepare the seasonings. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (if using). Adjust the amount of soy sauce depending on your desired level of saltiness."
5,"Once the soybeans are tender, drain any excess liquid using a colander. Return the drained soybeans back to the pot."
6,"Pour the prepared soy sauce mixture into the pot with the soybeans. Stir gently to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat."
7,"Simmer for another 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and reduces slightly. The soybeans should be well coated in the sauce."
8,"During the last few minutes of simmering, stir in sesame oil. Sesame oil adds a nutty aroma, but it's optional."
9,"Turn off the heat and let the Kongjang cool slightly in the pot before transferring it to a serving dish."
10,"Garnish with sesame seeds and serve Kongjang warm or at room temperature as a side dish with Korean meals. It also pairs well with rice bowls."
