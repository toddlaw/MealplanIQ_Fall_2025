PartA,"Make the Meatballs"
1,"In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, parsley, egg, milk, garlic, onion, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to gently mix all ingredients until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can make the meatballs tough."
2,"Shape the meatball mixture into uniform balls, approximately 1-inch in diameter. You can use a cookie scoop for ease and consistency in size."
Part B,"Cook the Meatballs"
3,"Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs in a single layer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until browned on all sides."
4,"Drain any excess fat from the skillet."
Part C,"Make the Spaghetti Sauce"
5,"Pour the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using) into the skillet with the browned meatballs. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."
6,"Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the meatballs to cook through."
Part D,"Cook the Spaghetti"
7,"While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions for al dente (typically 8-12 minutes)."
8,"Drain the cooked spaghetti and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water (optional)."
Part E,"Assemble and Serve"
9,"Transfer the cooked spaghetti to a large serving bowl. Top with the cooked meatballs and spoon the tomato sauce over everything. Toss gently to combine."
10,"Garnish with fresh basil leaves (optional) and serve with reserved pasta water (optional) for adjusting the consistency of the sauce if desired."
11,"Enjoy your delicious homemade spaghetti and meatballs!"
