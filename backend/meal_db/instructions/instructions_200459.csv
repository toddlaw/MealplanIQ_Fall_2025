step,instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts of water)."
2,"While the water heats up, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl."
3,"Optional: If using Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, add it to the egg mixture and whisk to combine."
4,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the guanciale (or pancetta, bacon) and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until crispy and golden brown. Remove the guanciale from the pan with a slotted spoon and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate."
5,"Do not discard the rendered fat in the pan. It will add flavor to the sauce."
6,"Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes). Reserve about Â½ cup of the starchy pasta cooking water before draining the pasta completely."
7,"Immediately after draining the pasta, add it to the hot pan with the reserved pasta water and the guanciale drippings.** Toss the pasta to coat it in the flavorful oil."
8,"Turn off the heat. Immediately add the egg mixture to the pan with the hot pasta and toss vigorously for about 1 minute. The heat from the pasta will help cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce."
9,"Work quickly! If the pan is too hot, the eggs will scramble instead of creating a smooth sauce."
10,"If the sauce seems too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water at a time, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach a desired creamy consistency."
11,"Season the pasta with additional black pepper (to taste) and serve immediately in warmed bowls."
12,"Garnish each serving with a sprinkle of reserved guanciale and enjoy your delicious Spaghetti Carbonara!"
