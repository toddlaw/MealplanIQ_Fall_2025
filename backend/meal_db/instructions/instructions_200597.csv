Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 400Â°F."
2,"Prepare the Garlic: Trim the top off the head of garlic to expose the cloves slightly. Drizzle the garlic head with olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Wrap the garlic head completely in aluminum foil."
3,"Roast the Garlic: Place the wrapped garlic head on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the garlic cloves are soft and tender. You can check for doneness by gently squeezing a clove; it should be very soft."
4,"Let the garlic cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, remove the cloves from the head and squeeze out the roasted garlic pulp into a small bowl."
5,"Mash the Roasted Garlic: Using a fork or a small mortar and pestle, mash the roasted garlic cloves into a paste. You can leave it slightly chunky or mash it until smooth, depending on your preference."
6,"Combine the Aioli Ingredients: In the bowl with the mashed garlic, add mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Stir or whisk until well combined and creamy."
7,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): If using, stir in chopped fresh parsley or chives for added freshness."
8,"Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. You may need to add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice to your preference."
9,"Serve the roasted garlic aioli immediately or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors will develop further over time."
10,"Enjoy the roasted garlic aioli as a delicious dipping sauce for bread, vegetables, roasted potatoes, or grilled meats. It's also a great spread for sandwiches and wraps!"
