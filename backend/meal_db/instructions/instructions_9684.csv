1,"In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg yolk and milk, mixing until the dough forms a ball."
2,"Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."
3,"Remove from the oven and let cool on baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
4,"This recipe is very simple and is always a hit with almost any crowd. To add some variation, you can mix a teaspoon of flavoring with the sugar; peppermint is particularly great, as are lemon and almond. You might also consider drizzling some melted chocolate over the top or leaving it plain. It can also be delicious as a dessert layered with whipped cream and raspberries!"
5,"If you wish to top with flaked almonds, let the dough rest for 15 minutes before adding the almonds on top; this will stop the almonds from sinking. When preparing for the kids, I skip this step to speed up the process."
