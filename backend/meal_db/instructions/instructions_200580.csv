1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt."
2,"Slowly pour the boiling water into the flour mixture, stirring constantly with chopsticks or a dough whisk until a shaggy dough forms."
3,"Optional: If the dough seems too dry, gradually add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together and forms a slightly sticky ball. Be careful not to overwork the dough."
4,"Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes."
5,"While the dough rests, prepare the filling: Heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced scallions and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until softened slightly. Season with a pinch of salt (optional) and five-spice powder (if using). Set aside to cool slightly."
6,"Optional: Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few minutes, or until golden brown. Watch closely to avoid burning."
7,"Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin circle (about 8-inch diameter) on a lightly floured surface."
8,"Brush the surface of each dough circle with a thin layer of vegetable oil."
9,"Sprinkle the cooled scallion filling evenly over the oiled surface, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge."
10,"Optional: Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the scallion filling (if using)."
11,"Fold the dough circle in half, then fold it in half again to form a triangle. Pinch the edges to seal the filling inside."
12,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat to 325Â°F. Carefully place one of the filled dough triangles into the hot oil."
13,"Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Use a spatula to gently press down on the pancake while it cooks to ensure even cooking."
14,"Transfer the cooked scallion pancake to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
15,"Repeat steps 12-14 to cook the remaining scallion pancakes. You may need to adjust the heat slightly as you cook more pancakes."
16,"Serve the scallion pancakes hot on their own or with your favorite dipping sauce, such as soy sauce with chili oil or a simple vinegar sauce."
