Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the Calamari: Pat the cleaned calamari bodies and tentacles dry with paper towels. Cut the calamari bodies into rings (about ¾-inch thick) and leave the tentacles whole."
2,"Marinate the Calamari (Optional): In a large bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, cayenne pepper (if using), paprika, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Add the calamari and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for extra tender calamari. Skip this step if not marinating."
3,"Prepare the Coating Station: Set up two shallow bowls. In the first bowl, place the all-purpose flour. In the second bowl, whisk together the buttermilk marinade (if used) or simply use fresh buttermilk."
4,"Heat the Oil: Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a temperature of 350°F. You can use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature."
5,"Dredge the Calamari: Dredge each piece of calamari in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Optional: If using the buttermilk marinade, dip the floured calamari back into the buttermilk mixture for a double coating. Finally, dredge again in the flour to ensure a crispy exterior."
6,"Fry the Calamari: Carefully add a few pieces of calamari at a time to the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the pan, as this will lower the oil temperature and result in soggy calamari. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
7,"Drain on Paper Towels: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried calamari to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil."
8,"Serve and Enjoy: Serve the fried calamari hot with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. You can also enjoy them with marinara sauce or aioli for dipping."
