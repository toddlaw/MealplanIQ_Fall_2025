1,"Marinate the Beef: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
3,"Sear the Beef: Add the marinated beef to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through (depending on the desired level of doneness)."
4,"Remove the Beef: Once cooked, transfer the seared beef to a plate and set aside."
5,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, the remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar, and white pepper. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and brown sugar to your preference for saltiness and sweetness."
6,"Add the Sauce to the Wok: Pour the prepared sauce into the hot wok. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally."
7,"Return the Beef: Add the cooked beef back to the wok with the simmering sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the beef in the sauce."
8,"Simmer and Thicken: Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for an additional minute, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the beef."
9,"Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in a few drops of water (optional) to adjust the consistency of the sauce if needed. Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Mongolian beef!"
