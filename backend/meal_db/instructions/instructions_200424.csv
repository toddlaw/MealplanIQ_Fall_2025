1,"Prepare the Cornstarch Slurry: In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the chicken broth to create a smooth slurry."
2,"Bring Broth to a Simmer: In a medium saucepan, bring the remaining chicken broth to a simmer over medium heat."
3,"Season the Broth: Add the soy sauce, sesame oil (if using), ginger, garlic (if using), and white pepper to the simmering broth. Stir to combine and taste, adjusting the soy sauce and white pepper to your preference."
4,"Slowly Stir in the Eggs: While the broth simmers, gently whisk the eggs in a separate bowl. Slowly drizzle the beaten eggs into the simmering broth in a thin stream while constantly stirring the broth in a circular motion with a fork or whisk. This will create the classic "egg ribbons" in the soup."
5,"Cook Until Eggs Are Set: Continue stirring for a minute or two, or until the egg ribbons are cooked through and no longer appear cloudy."
6,"Serve Immediately: Turn off the heat and ladle the egg drop soup into serving bowls. Garnish with chopped scallions and serve hot. Enjoy your comforting and delicious egg drop soup!"
