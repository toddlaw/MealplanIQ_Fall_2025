Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 375°F."
2,"Prepare the Potatoes: Peel the russet potatoes and cut them into thin slices (about 1/8 inch thick). You can use a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife for even slices."
3,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the potato slices for 2-3 minutes. This step helps to remove some starch and can lead to a creamier gratin (optional). Drain the potatoes well and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process."
4,"Cook the Bacon: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside."
5,"Sauté the Onion and Garlic: In the same skillet with the remaining bacon fat, add the diced onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
6,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
7,"Deglaze the Pan (Optional): Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the wine simmer for a minute or two, allowing some of the alcohol to evaporate."
8,"**Combine the Creamy Sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the heavy cream and chicken broth. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste."
9,"Assemble the Tartiflette: In a large baking dish (around 9x13 inch), layer half of the sliced potatoes. Sprinkle with half of the cooked bacon and half of the shredded Gruyère cheese."
10,"Pour half of the creamy sauce mixture over the first layer."
11,"Repeat the layering process with the remaining potatoes, bacon, Gruyère cheese, and creamy sauce."
12,"Top with Reblochon Cheese: Place the whole Reblochon cheese wheel on top of the final layer, with the rind facing up. You can cut the rind slightly to allow some of the cheese to melt through."
13,"Optional Step (For Extra Herbs): Tuck in the fresh thyme sprigs around the cheese (if using)."
14,"Bake the tartiflette in the preheated oven for 45-55 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender, the sauce is bubbly, and the cheese is melted and golden brown on top."
15,"Remove the tartiflette from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the gratin to set and prevents it from being too runny."
16,"Serve the tartiflette hot as a delicious and comforting main dish. Enjoy!"
