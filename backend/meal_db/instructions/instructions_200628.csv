1,"Prepare the Cucumbers:  Wash and halve the cucumber lengthwise.  Discard the seeds and thinly slice the cucumber."
2,"Salt the Cucumbers (Optional): In a large bowl, toss the sliced cucumbers with a pinch of salt (optional). Let them sit for 10-15 minutes to draw out some moisture. Drain any released liquid."
3,"Make the Dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the rice vinegar, mirin, sugar, and a pinch of salt until the sugar dissolves."
4,"Optional Kombu Addition:  For added umami flavor (optional), add a small piece of kombu to the dressing and let it sit for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the kombu piece before using the dressing."
5,"Combine and Marinate: Add the sliced cucumbers to the prepared dressing.  **Optional:** If using wakame seaweed or shredded carrots, add them to the bowl at this point. Toss gently to coat the cucumbers and vegetables evenly in the dressing."
6,"Marinate for at least 15 minutes: Let the sunomono salad marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes, or up to an hour, to allow the flavors to develop."
7,"Serve and Enjoy:  Transfer the marinated cucumber salad to a serving dish. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds (optional), shiso leaves (optional), or a few thin strips of red chili pepper (optional). Serve cold as a refreshing side dish or appetizer."
