1,"Separate two of the eggs. In the upper part of a double boiler, mix 1 whole egg and 2 yolks with 1/4 cup of sugar and salt, whisking until well combined. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook over simmering water, stirring continuously with a spatula or wooden spoon. Once the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, take it off the heat. (Avoid boiling. If the custard begins to curdle, remove it from the heat and beat vigorously until smooth.) Pour the custard through a strainer into a bowl and mix in the vanilla. Let it cool and then refrigerate."
2,"In a heat-safe bowl, gently whisk the 2 egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, just enough to dissolve the sugar. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and continuously stir until the egg whites reach a temperature of 145 degrees F (63 C) or higher. Quickly take the bowl off the heat and use an electric mixer to whip the warm egg whites until they achieve stiff, glossy peaks."
3,"Transfer the chilled custard into a serving dish. Spoon the meringue onto the custard in heaping tablespoonfuls to create islands. Refrigerate before serving."
