Part A,"Preparation"
1,"Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This helps ensure crispy skin."
2,"In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with baking powder, kosher salt, and black pepper.  Use your hands to make sure the seasoning is evenly distributed."
3,"Let the wings rest in the seasoning mixture for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator for even more flavorful wings (optional)."
Part B,"Baking Method (Optional)"
4,"(Optional) Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup."
5,"(Optional) Arrange the chicken wings in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes, then flip the wings and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy."
Part C,"Frying Method"
6,"(Alternatively, you can fry the wings for a more traditional buffalo wing experience. Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.)"
7,"(For frying) Carefully add a few chicken wings at a time to the hot oil to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. An internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit in the thickest part of the wing is ideal."
8,"(For frying) Once fried, transfer the wings to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
Part D,"Make the Buffalo Sauce"
9,"In a medium bowl, whisk together the hot sauce, melted butter, white vinegar, garlic powder, paprika (optional), and cayenne pepper (optional) to create your buffalo sauce. You can adjust the amount of hot sauce depending on your desired level of spiciness."
Part E,"Serve"
10,"Toss the cooked chicken wings in the buffalo sauce to coat them evenly."
11,"Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauces like blue cheese or ranch dressing. Enjoy your delicious homemade buffalo wings!"
