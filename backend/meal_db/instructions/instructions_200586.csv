Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 425Â°F."
2,"Wash and dry the sweet potatoes. Cut them into wedges or cubes, depending on your preference. Aim for pieces that are about 1-inch thick."
3,"In a large bowl, toss the sweet potato pieces with olive oil, honey, five-spice powder, salt, and black pepper. Make sure the sweet potatoes are evenly coated."
4,"Optional: If using rosemary, add the sprigs to the bowl and toss them with the sweet potatoes."
5,"Spread the seasoned sweet potato pieces in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Don't overcrowd the pan, as this will prevent them from crisping up properly."
6,"Roast the sweet potatoes for 25-30 minutes, or until tender and golden brown on the edges. Flip the sweet potatoes halfway through cooking for even browning."
7,"Optional: For an extra crispy finish, you can broil the sweet potatoes for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. Watch them closely to avoid burning."
8,"Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and discard the rosemary sprigs (if used)."
9,"Serve the five-spice roasted sweet potatoes hot as a side dish or enjoy them on their own."
10,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 4 servings. You can adjust the amount of five-spice powder, honey, salt, and pepper to your preference. Leftover roasted sweet potatoes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a skillet over medium heat with a little oil until warmed through, or toast them in a toaster oven until crispy again."
