1,"In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to gently mix the ingredients until just combined. Avoid overworking the meat, as this can make the burgers tough."
2,"Shape the hamburger mixture into 4 equal patties. Gently press a thumbprint in the center of each patty to help prevent them from puffing up while cooking."
3,"Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill pan, you can add a tablespoon of cooking oil for greasing."
4,"Place the hamburger patties on the preheated grill or grill pan."
5,"Grill the patties for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the thickest patty should read 160 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare."
6,"While the burgers are cooking, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster, if desired."
7,"Once cooked, place the hamburger patties on the toasted buns. Add your favorite toppings like cheese slices, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc."
8,"Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious homemade hamburgers!"
