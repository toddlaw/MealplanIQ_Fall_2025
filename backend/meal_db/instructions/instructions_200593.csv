Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 325°F."
2,"In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
3,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."
4,"Salting the Vegetables (Optional):  Here, you can use two methods for salting the vegetables (choose one):
4a,"Method 1:** Sprinkle the cubed eggplant with 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a colander. Toss to coat and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. This step helps to draw out excess moisture, resulting in a less watery ratatouille. Rinse the eggplant thoroughly under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels before adding it to the pot."
4b,"Method 2 (Skip if using Method 1):**  Add the cubed eggplant directly to the pot with the softened onion and garlic. Continue to step 5."
5,"Increase the heat to medium-high and add the cubed eggplant, zucchini, and yellow squash to the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften slightly."
6,"Add the diced red bell pepper and cook for another 2-3 minutes."
7,"Stir in the chopped tomatoes, fresh thyme sprigs, bay leaf (or bouquet garni, if using), salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste."
8,"Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking."
9,"Optional Step (For a Thicker Sauce):** If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can remove the lid during the last 15 minutes of cooking to allow some of the liquid to evaporate."
10,"Once the vegetables are cooked, remove the pot from the heat and discard the thyme sprigs, bay leaf, or bouquet garni (if used)."
11,"Two Serving Options:"
11a,"Rustic Presentation:** Transfer the ratatouille mixture to a serving dish and garnish with fresh basil leaves (optional)."
11b,"Layered Presentation (Optional):** Arrange the sliced vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash) in a decorative pattern in a baking dish or oven-safe skillet. Carefully pour the cooked vegetable sauce over the top, ensuring all the vegetables are covered."
12,"Optional Step (For Layered Presentation):  If doing the layered presentation, bake the ratatouille in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are heated through and the top is slightly golden brown."
13,"Serve the Provençal ratatouille hot as a side dish or vegetarian main course. Enjoy!"
