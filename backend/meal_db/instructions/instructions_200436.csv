1,"Marinate the Beef: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
3,"Sear the Beef: Add the marinated beef to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through to your desired level of doneness (remove sooner for a more rare center)."
4,"Remove the Beef: Once cooked, transfer the seared beef to a plate and set aside."
5,"Prepare the Sauce: In the same wok, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat."
6,"Toast the Chili Peppers: Add the dried red chilies and toast them for a few seconds until fragrant, be careful not to burn them. Take note of the fumes, which can irritate the eyes."
7,"Add Aromatics: Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
8,"Stir-fry the Doubanjiang: Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry for an additional minute, allowing the flavors to release and the paste to become fragrant."
9,"Season with Sichuan Peppercorns: Add the ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir-fry for a few seconds more."
10,"Deglaze the Wok (Optional): Add a splash of chicken broth to deglaze the wok, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom (this adds extra flavor to the sauce)."
11,"Pour in Remaining Sauce Ingredients: Add the remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and chicken broth. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally."
12,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl to create a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
13,"Return the Beef: Add the cooked beef back to the wok with the simmering sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the beef in the sauce."
14,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the beef."
15,"Serve: Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped green onions (scallions). Serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Hunan beef with its spicy and savory flavors!
