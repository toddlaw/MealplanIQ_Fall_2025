Step,Instruction
1,"Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until softened and translucent."
2,"Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic."
3,"Rinse the long-grain white rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky."
4,"Add the rinsed rice to the pot with the onions and garlic. Stir to coat the rice with the oil and seasonings."
5,"Pour in the chicken broth and tomato sauce. Season with salt and ground cumin. Stir to combine everything evenly."
6,"Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed. Do not peek or lift the lid during cooking to allow the rice to steam properly."
7,"Optional Step: During the last minute of cooking, you can add chopped fresh cilantro and/or chopped fresh parsley for extra flavor."
8,"Once the cooking time is complete, turn off the heat and let the rice stand for 5 minutes with the lid still on. This allows the rice to continue to absorb any remaining liquid and fluff up slightly."
9,"Fluff the rice gently with a fork before serving. You can also add the chopped Serrano pepper (if using) for a touch of heat at this point."
10,"Serve Mexican Rice warm as a side dish with your favorite Mexican meals. It pairs well with grilled meats, stews, burritos, or tacos."
