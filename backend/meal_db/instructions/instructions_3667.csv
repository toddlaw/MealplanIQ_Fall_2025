1,"Fill a large bowl with water. Add rice and allow it to soak for 10 minutes; then drain and rinse until the water runs clear."
2,"Melt 1/4 cup butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; sautï¿½ the orzo in the hot butter-oil mixture until it is lightly browned, which takes about 5 minutes. Stir in the drained rice and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook and stir the orzo-rice mixture until the rice is coated in the butter-oil mixture and begins to become translucent, approximately 5 minutes."
3,"Pour 4 cups of water over the rice mixture and add salt; stir and bring to a boil. Cover the skillet, lower the heat, and simmer until the rice is fluffy and tender but still firm, about 20 minutes."
4,"Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the almonds until they are toasted and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Then, mix in the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and tahini until the almonds are well coated."
5,"Combine the almond mixture with the rice mixture."
6,"Drizzle a bit of lemon juice over the rice at the end for an extra tang."
7,"Experiment with other roasted nuts such as pistachios or cashews, or incorporate some golden raisins for additional variety."
8,"Some restaurants opt for small pieces of vermicelli or angel hair pasta in place of orzo, so you can choose to substitute them if you wish."
