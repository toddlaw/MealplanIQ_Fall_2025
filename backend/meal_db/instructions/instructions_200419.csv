1,"Prepare Ingredients: Ensure all ingredients are prepped and ready to go for quick stir-frying. Dice the char siu pork (or ham/sausage) and shrimp. Chop the scallions."
2,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat for one minute. Add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil (or vegetable oil) and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
3,"Scramble the Eggs: Beat the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt. Once the oil is hot, add the eggs and scramble them until cooked through. Remove the cooked eggs from the wok and set aside in a bowl."
4,"Stir-fry the Protein: Add another 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok. Sear the shrimp for 2-3 minutes, or until pink and cooked through. Season with a generous pinch of salt. Remove the shrimp from the wok and set aside with the eggs."
5,"Cook the Char Siu Pork (or Substitute): Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the wok. Stir-fry the diced char siu pork (or ham/sausage) for 1 minute to release its flavors."
6,"Add the Rice: Push the cooked char siu pork to the side of the wok. Add the cooked white rice to the center of the wok and break it up with a spatula. Let the rice heat through for a minute, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking."
7,"Incorporate the Sauce: Make a well in the center of the rice and pour in the light soy sauce. Stir the rice to evenly distribute the sauce."
8,"Combine Everything: Add the cooked eggs, shrimp, frozen vegetables, and cooked char siu pork back to the wok. Toss everything together to combine and heat through for an additional 1-2 minutes."
9,"Season and Serve: Season the fried rice with salt and ground white pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped scallions and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious Yangzhou fried rice!"
