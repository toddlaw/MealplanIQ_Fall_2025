Step,Instruction
1,"Slowly incorporate the flour into the liquid ingredients, mixing until a rough dough forms. Then, knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 5 to 10 minutes."
2,"Lightly flour a pastry cloth. Sift 1 1/2 cups of flour with salt onto a board and create a well in the center. Pour the beaten egg combined with 1/3 cup of warm milk, 2 teaspoons of melted butter, and vinegar into the well. You might need to add more milk depending on the type of flour you are using."
3,"In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the melted butter, then add the egg and milk, mixing well until smooth."
4,"Roll the dough out on the board as thinly as you can. Transfer it to the table. Start stretching the dough gently from the center outward, taking care not to tear it. It should stretch to approximately 1 yard square. A thicker edge or border will form as you work, and any excess should be trimmed with a knife before applying the filling or rolling up the pastry. Fill the pastry with the desired ingredients and either roll or fold it over."
5,"Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving."
