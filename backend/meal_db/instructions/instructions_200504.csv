Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the fillings: Julienne the cucumber and thinly slice the avocado (if using)."
2,"Prepare the rolling station: Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. This will prevent the rice from sticking to the mat."
3,"Assemble the roll: Place half of the nori seaweed sheet on the plastic-wrapped bamboo mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin and even layer of cooked sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Dip your fingers in water to prevent sticking as you spread the rice."
4,"Add the filling: Arrange a line of julienned cucumber in the center of the rice, closer to the bottom edge. Top the cucumber with a layer of thinly sliced avocado (if using)."
5,"Add salmon: Next to the avocado (or cucumber if not using avocado), arrange a row of thinly sliced salmon."
6,"Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, carefully lift the bottom edge of the mat over the filling. Gently roll the mat forward, applying light pressure to form a tight cylinder. Use the plastic wrap to help you shape the roll and seal the edge."
7,"Shape and cut: Once rolled, remove the bamboo mat and plastic wrap. Moisten a sharp knife with water and cut the roll into 6-8 even pieces."
8,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle the salmon roll pieces with white sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
9,"Serve: Enjoy your salmon roll with wasabi paste and pickled ginger (optional)!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"Ensure the salmon is sashimi-grade for safe consumption raw."
2,"This recipe offers flexibility with the fillings. You can include avocado for a richer flavor or omit it for a simpler version."
3,"Wetting your fingers with water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while spreading."
4,"If you don't have a bamboo sushi mat, you can use a parchment paper sheet instead."
