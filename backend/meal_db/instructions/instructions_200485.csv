1,"Prepare the filling: In a bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese (if using), Parmesan cheese, pepperoni, cooked sausage (if using), and chopped vegetables (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the filling aside."
2,"Preheat your oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup (optional)."
3,"Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough piece into a circle about 10-12 inches in diameter."
4,"Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce (about 2-3 tablespoons) on one half of each dough circle, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge."
5,"Spoon your prepared filling mixture evenly over the sauced half of the dough circle."
6,"Fold the plain dough half over the filled half, forming a semi-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal the calzone. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch."
7,"Whisk the beaten egg in a small bowl. Brush the top and edges of each calzone with the egg wash."
8,"Drizzle the tops of the calzones with a little olive oil."
9,"Using a sharp knife, cut a small vent (about ½ inch) on the top of each calzone to allow steam to escape during baking."
10,"Place the calzones on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly and hot."
11,"Optional: Broil the calzones for the last minute or two for an extra crispy crust. Keep a close eye on them under the broiler to prevent burning."
12,"Let the calzones cool slightly for a few minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set and prevents it from becoming runny."
13,"Serve your Calzone hot, with your favorite dipping sauce (optional) and enjoy!"
