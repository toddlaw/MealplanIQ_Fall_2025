1,"In a large mixing bowl, combine milk and sugar, whisking until the sugar is fully dissolved. Add the yeast and allow the mixture to sit for about 10 minutes, or until a frothy layer appears on the surface. Next, incorporate the flour, the majority of the beaten eggs (set aside roughly 1 tablespoon in a small bowl for later use), vegetable oil, and salt; mix until well blended."
2,"Transfer the dough onto a generously floured surface and knead it until it becomes smooth and elastic, which should take around 10 minutes. The dough should feel slightly tacky. Put the dough in a large greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, set the bowl in a warm area, and allow it to rise until it has doubled in size, approximately 2 to 3 hours."
3,"Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper."
4,"Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it briefly to deflate, about 1 minute. Shape the dough into a rope, then cut it into 12 evenly sized pieces. Form each piece into a ball, and flatten each ball with your fingers into a disk approximately 5 to 6 inches wide."
5,"Spoon approximately 2 tablespoons of your preferred bun filling into the center of the dough circle, then fold the edges of the dough over the filling. Pinch and twist the top to secure the filling inside, ensuring there are no gaps. Arrange each filled bun seam-side down on the parchment paper while you complete the remaining buns. Cover the filled buns with plastic wrap and allow them to rise for 30 minutes."
6,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the reserved beaten egg with water; then brush the mixture over the tops of each bun and sprinkle some sesame seeds on top."
7,"Bake the buns in the preheated oven until the tops are golden and glossy, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, for 20 to 30 minutes. Serve while warm."
