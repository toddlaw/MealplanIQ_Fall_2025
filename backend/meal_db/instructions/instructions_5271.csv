1,"In a small bowl, mix yeast and sugar into warm water until dissolved. Allow to sit until creamy, about 10 minutes. To create crumpet rings, cut aluminum foil into 7x12 inch rectangles. Fold the rectangles in half lengthwise and then in thirds to create 6 layers. Shape into a 3 1/2 inch diameter circle and secure with tape on the outside."
2,"In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the milk, oil, and yeast mixture, stirring until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 60 minutes. Lightly grease or butter the inside of the crumpet rings and dip them in cornmeal."
3,"Warm a griddle or frying pan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle cornmeal on the griddle and position the rings on it. Deflate the batter by stirring. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into each ring. Cook slowly for approximately 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Carefully take off the rings and flip the biscuits. Bake on the other side for about 8 minutes or until they are light brown. Move to a rack to cool."
