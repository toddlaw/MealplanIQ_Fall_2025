1,"Whisk together the eggs and pepper in one bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the crumbled cheese with the milk."
2,"Warm the oil in a large skillet that's non-stick over medium-high heat. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, ensuring the base is uniformly covered. Wait for the edges to look cooked, then lay the feta mixture in a line at the middle of the eggs. Use a spatula to fold the eggs over the cheese from the top and bottom, followed by folding in the sides."
