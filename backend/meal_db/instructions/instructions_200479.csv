1,"Preheat your oven to 400°F."
2,"Prepare the chicken: Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness of about ½ inch. You can place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound them gently."
3,"Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper to taste."
4,"Set up three shallow bowls for dredging the chicken. In the first bowl, place the all-purpose flour. In the second bowl, whisk the eggs. In the third bowl, combine the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese."
5,"Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it next into the beaten egg mixture, coating it evenly. Finally, coat the chicken completely in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere."
6,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, but not smoking, carefully add the breaded chicken breasts."
7,"Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. You can cut into the thickest part of the chicken to check if it's white and cooked through with no pink remaining."
8,"Optional: If the chicken breasts are too thick, you can finish cooking them in the oven after pan-frying. Transfer the browned chicken to a baking dish and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until cooked through."
9,"While the chicken cooks, heat the marinara sauce in a saucepan over low heat. You can simmer the sauce gently for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld."
10,"Transfer the cooked chicken breasts to a plate or baking dish. Spoon some of the warmed marinara sauce over each chicken breast."
11,"Top the chicken with the shredded mozzarella cheese."
12,"Bake the chicken parmesan in the preheated oven for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly."
13,"Optional: Broil the chicken for the last minute or two for an extra crispy cheese topping. Keep a close eye on the chicken under the broiler to prevent burning."
14,"Let the chicken parmesan cool slightly for a few minutes before serving. This allows the cheese to set and prevents it from becoming runny."
15,"Serve your Chicken Parmesan with your favorite sides, such as pasta, spaghetti squash, or roasted vegetables. Garnish with fresh chopped basil leaves (optional) and enjoy!"
