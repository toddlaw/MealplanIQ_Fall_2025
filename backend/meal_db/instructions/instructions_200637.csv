Step,Instruction
1,"Drain and Press (Optional): If using silken tofu, you can skip this step. If using regular soft tofu, carefully remove the tofu from the package and drain any excess liquid. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and place a weight (like a heavy book) on top to gently press out some of the excess moisture for 10-15 minutes (optional).
2,"Chill the Tofu:  Unwrap the tofu and cut it into squares or slices, depending on your preference. Place the tofu slices on a plate and transfer them to the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.
3,"Prepare the Sauce (Optional): In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, mirin (if using), and dashi stock (if using) to create a simple dipping sauce.
4,"Prepare the Garnishes: While the tofu chills, grate the fresh ginger and thinly slice the scallions.
5,"Assemble and Serve: Arrange the chilled tofu slices on a serving plate. Drizzle with a little soy sauce or serve with the prepared dipping sauce (optional). Top with grated ginger, sliced scallions, and your choice of additional garnishes like bonito flakes (katsuobushi), a touch of wasabi paste, and toasted white sesame seeds.
6,"Enjoy! Serve the hiyayakko cold and enjoy its refreshing simplicity.
