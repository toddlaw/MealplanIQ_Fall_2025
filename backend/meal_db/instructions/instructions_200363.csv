1,"Prepare the chicken breasts by pounding them to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and black pepper."
2,"Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with all-purpose flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with panko breadcrumbs."
3,"Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat it in the panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere."
4,"Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it reaches 350Â°F."
5,"Carefully place the breaded chicken breasts in the hot oil and fry for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. You may need to fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding the skillet."
6,"Once the chicken is cooked through and crispy, transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil."
7,"While the chicken is resting, thinly slice the cabbage and prepare the tonkatsu sauce for serving."
8,"Slice the chicken katsu into strips and serve it hot alongside the shredded cabbage and tonkatsu sauce. Enjoy!"
