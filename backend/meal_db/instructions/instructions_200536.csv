1,"In a large bowl, whisk together masa harina, baking powder, and salt."
2,"In a separate bowl, melt vegetable shortening. Slowly add the hot shortening to the dry ingredients, mixing with a spoon until a crumbly mixture forms."
3,"Gradually add chicken broth, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but not wet. Knead for several minutes until smooth and elastic."
4,"Soak dried corn husks in a large bowl of hot water for at least 30 minutes, or until softened and pliable. Rinse each husk under running water to remove any dirt."
5,"Spread a thin layer of masa dough onto the wide end of a softened corn husk. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the husk."
6,"Prepare your chosen cheese filling: crumble queso fresco, shred Monterey Jack or Oaxacan cheese, or combine shredded cheese with chopped roasted poblano peppers (optional)."
7,"Add 2-3 tablespoons of cheese filling to the center of the dough. If using spices, sprinkle a pinch of cumin and chili powder over the filling (optional)."
8,"Fold the sides of the husk over the filling to enclose it. Fold the bottom of the husk up to create a closed package."
9,"Repeat step 5-8 with remaining dough and filling. Arrange tamales standing upright in a steamer basket. If necessary, steam tamales in batches."
10,"Fill a steamer pot with enough water to reach just below the steamer basket. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Steam tamales for 1-1.5 hours, or until the masa is cooked through and easily detaches from the corn husk."
11,"Let tamales cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!"
