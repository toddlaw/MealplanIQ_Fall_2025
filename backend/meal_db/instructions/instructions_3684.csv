1,"Combine garbanzo beans, parsley, onion, flour, garlic, cumin, baking powder, coriander, salt, lemon juice, and black pepper in a food processor or blender. Pulse until the mixture is combined and forms a chunky, slightly sticky consistency."
2,"Roll the mixture into small balls and arrange them on a plate. Flatten each ball into patties that are 2 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick."
3,"Put the patties in the refrigerator or freezer for about 10 minutes to help them firm up."
4,"Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches and bring it to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
5,"Serve the patties warm with your choice of dipping sauce."
6,"If the edges of the patties crack when you flatten them, incorporate a small amount of water into the bean mixture. Conversely, if the mixture is too wet, add up to 2 tablespoons of flour to the blend."
7,"The nutritional value of the oil used for frying is estimated based on a retention rate of 10% after cooking. The actual amount may vary depending on factors like cooking duration and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific kind of oil utilized."
