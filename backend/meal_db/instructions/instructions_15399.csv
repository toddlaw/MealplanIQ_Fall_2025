1,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl."
2,"Cream together the butter and 1 1/2 cups of sugar using an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy and light. Beat in the room-temperature eggs one at a time until fully combined. Stir in vanilla with the last egg. Gradually add the flour mixture and sour cream, alternating, and mix until just combined."
3,"Combine walnuts, 3/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. Gently fold half of the walnut mixture into the batter, mixing until evenly incorporated. Transfer the batter to the greased pan, and sprinkle the remaining walnut mixture on top."
4,"Bake in the oven preheated until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, for about 45 minutes. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."
