1,"Combine yeast, warm water, and 1 cup of bread flour in a large bowl; let the mixture stand until frothy bubbles appear, about 10 minutes. Add vegetable oil, honey, 3 eggs, and salt, mixing well. Beat in 2 additional cups of bread flour and the whole wheat flour, alternating by cupfuls until the dough becomes too stiff to stir in more flour."
2,"Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, incorporating more flour if necessary to achieve a slightly sticky dough. Shape the dough into a round, then place it in an oiled bowl, turning it a few times to coat the surface. Cover the bowl with a plastic bag and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, approximately 1 to 2 hours."
3,"Cut the first piece of dough into 3 equal parts, then set aside the remaining dough under a cloth to prevent it from drying out while braiding the first loaf."
4,"Braid the dough by rolling the pieces into ropes, then braiding them like a challah loaf. Repeat with the other pieces and let the loaves rise until doubled in size."
5,"Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl, then brush this mixture over the braided challah loaves. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top."
6,"Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are a deep golden brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, approximately 40 minutes. Allow to cool on a rack before slicing."
7,"Refrigerate the dough after placing it in the bowl if you want to slow down the rising process, such as making the dough on Wednesday evening to bake it on Thursday evening. This method should help control the yeast's growth so that the dough is ready for the next stage later on Thursday."
