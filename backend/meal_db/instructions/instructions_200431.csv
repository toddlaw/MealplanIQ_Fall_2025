1,"Rehydrate the Mushrooms: In a small bowl, cover the dried shiitake mushrooms with hot water and let them soak for 15-20 minutes, or until softened. Remove the mushrooms from the water and thinly slice them. Reserve the soaking liquid."
2,"Bring Broth to a Simmer: In a large pot or Dutch oven, bring the chicken broth to a simmer over medium heat."
3,"Add Seasonings: Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and white pepper to the simmering broth. Stir to combine and taste, adjusting the amount of soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper to your preference for saltiness, sourness, and spice."
4,"Make the Cornstarch Slurry: In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with the cold water until smooth. Set aside."
5,"Add Vegetables and Mushrooms: Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms, cubed tofu, and sliced bamboo shoots (if using) to the simmering broth. Let them simmer for 3-5 minutes, or until heated through."
6,"Slowly Stir in the Cornstarch Slurry: Gradually whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering soup. Continue stirring for a minute or two, or until the soup thickens slightly to your desired consistency."
7,"Temper the Eggs: In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs well. Slowly drizzle the beaten eggs into the simmering soup while constantly stirring the broth in a circular motion with a fork or whisk. This will create the classic "egg ribbons" in the soup."
8,"Cook Until Eggs Are Set: Continue stirring for another minute or two, or until the egg ribbons are cooked through and no longer appear cloudy."
9,"Serve: Turn off the heat and ladle the hot and sour soup into serving bowls. Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately. Enjoy your comforting and flavorful hot and sour soup!"
