1,"Marinate the Beef: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine (or sherry), and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Prepare the Broccoli: While the beef marinates, wash and cut the broccoli florets into bite-sized pieces. You can also steam the broccoli florets for a few minutes to slightly soften them (optional)."
3,"Whisk the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine (or sherry), oyster sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Set the sauce aside."
4,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
5,"Sear the Beef: Add the marinated beef to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through (depending on the desired level of doneness)."
6,"Remove the Beef: Once cooked, transfer the seared beef to a plate and set aside."
7,"Stir-fry the Broccoli: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. If the broccoli isn't pre-steamed, add it to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened and bright green."
8,"Add the Sauce: Pour the prepared sauce into the wok with the broccoli. Stir-fry for an additional minute, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly."
9,"Return the Beef: Add the cooked beef back to the wok with the broccoli and sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the beef in the sauce."
10,"Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in a few drops of sesame oil (optional) for extra flavor. Garnish with chopped scallions (optional) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Chinese-style beef with broccoli!"
