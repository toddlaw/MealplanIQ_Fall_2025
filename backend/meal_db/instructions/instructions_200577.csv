Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the Tofu: Drain the tofu and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes. Gently press the tofu cubes between paper towels to remove any excess moisture."
2,"Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the fermented chili bean paste (doubanjiang) and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant and the oil turns red."
3,"Add the minced garlic, ginger, and ground Sichuan peppercorn (if using) to the wok. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
4,"Optional: If using Sichuan peppercorns, briefly toast them in a dry skillet over low heat until fragrant. Grind them in a mortar and pestle (or crush with a spoon) and set aside."
5,"Add the ground pork to the wok and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and cooked through."
6,"Pour in the chicken broth, soy sauce, sugar, and Shaoxing wine (if using). Bring to a simmer."
7,"In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce to thicken it slightly."
8,"Gently add the tofu cubes to the wok and stir to coat them in the sauce. Be careful not to break the tofu."
9,"Simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the tofu is heated through."
10,"Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped scallion whites."
11,"Optional: Sprinkle the ground Sichuan peppercorns (if toasted) over the dish for a numbing flavor."
12,"Serve the mapo tofu hot over rice. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro (optional) and additional chopped scallion greens (optional)."
13,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 2-3 servings. You can adjust the amount of fermented chili bean paste (doubanjiang) to your desired level of spice. Shaoxing wine adds a depth of flavor but can be omitted. Substitute with additional chicken broth. Leftover mapo tofu can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through, as the tofu may become rubbery if reheated at high temperatures.
