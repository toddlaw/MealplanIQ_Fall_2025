1,"Remove the steaks from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. This ensures even cooking."
2,"Using a mortar and pestle, spice grinder, or a heavy object and plastic bag, coarsely crush the black peppercorns. You can also use pre-cracked black pepper, but crushing them yourself will provide a more intense and fresh flavor."
3,"Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with kosher salt on all sides."
4,"Press the crushed black peppercorns firmly onto both sides of the steaks, coating them evenly. You can use your fingers or the back of a spoon to help press the peppercorns into the meat."
5,"Heat a large cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and let it shimmer until hot."
6,"Sear the steaks for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time depending on your desired level of doneness (rare: 2-3 minutes per side; medium: 4-5 minutes per side; medium-well: 5-6 minutes per side)."
7,"Transfer the steaks to a plate and tent them loosely with foil to let them rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat for a more tender and flavorful steak."
8,"While the steaks rest, remove any excess oil from the pan, leaving behind the browned bits. Add the minced shallot and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until softened and fragrant."
9,"Deglaze the pan with the cognac or brandy, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for a minute or two, allowing the alcohol to burn off slightly."
10,"Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Let the sauce simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens slightly and reduces by about half. You can whisk occasionally to prevent burning."
11,"Stir in the cold butter and green peppercorns (if using) to the sauce. Swirl the pan to incorporate the butter and let it melt, adding a silky texture to the sauce."
12,"Season the sauce with additional salt and pepper to taste (if needed)."
13,"Slice the rested steaks and serve them on plates with the creamy peppercorn sauce spooned over the top. Enjoy!"
