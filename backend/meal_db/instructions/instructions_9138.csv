1,"In a mixing bowl, combine milk, eggs, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg; blend until the mixture is smooth."
2,"Heat a well-seasoned griddle over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter onto the griddle and spread it into a thin layer. Cook until the top appears almost dry, about 1 to 1.5 minutes. Carefully slide a long, thin spatula beneath the pancake to loosen the edges, then flip it over. Keep cooking until the second side is lightly browned, approximately 1 minute more."
3,"Roll up the pancakes and serve them in small batches."
4,"My Grandma always said that they weren't genuine Swedish pancakes unless made on a cast iron griddle. They can also be prepared using a plett pan, which produces silver dollar pancakes. Both methods are traditional. Crepe pans are effective too, as are electric nonstick griddles."
5,"The pancakes can be held in a warm oven set to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C) until all are cooked and ready to serve."
