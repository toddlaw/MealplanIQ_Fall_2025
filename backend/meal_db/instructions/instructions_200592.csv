Step,Instruction
A,"Prepare the Ingredients"
1. "Green Beans: Wash and trim the green beans. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the green beans for 3-5 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process."
2. "Eggs: Bring another pot of water to a boil. Carefully lower the eggs into the boiling water and cook for 7 minutes for hard-boiled eggs. Alternatively, you can use a steamer for 6-7 minutes. Remove the eggs from the hot water and place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Once cool, peel the eggs and cut them into wedges."
3. "Optional - Anchovies (if using):** Rinse the anchovies under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels."
B,"Assemble the Salad"
4. "In a large serving bowl, arrange the cooked green beans, halved cherry tomatoes, pitted Kalamata olives, sliced red onion, and tuna (flaked)."
5. Optional Additions:** If using, add boiled potato wedges, roasted red pepper slices, or Nicoise olives."
6. "Arrange the hard-boiled egg wedges on top of the salad."
C,"Prepare the Vinaigrette"
7. "In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired."
8. "Pour the vinaigrette over the salad just before serving. Gently toss to coat all ingredients."
D,"Serve and Enjoy"
9,"Garnish the salad with fresh basil leaves (or chopped dill or chives, if using). Serve the salade Niçoise immediately at room temperature."
10,"Notes: This recipe is a classic version of salade Niçoise. Feel free to adjust the ingredients based on your preferences and what you have available. Leftover salade Niçoise can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. The lettuce may become wilted, but the salad will still be flavorful."
