1,"Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent browning."
2,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic burn."
3,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to thicken the sauce."

8,"Optional: If using fresh pasta, you can add it directly to the pan with the seafood sauce in the last minute or two of cooking, allowing it to cook and absorb the flavors of the sauce."
9,"If using cooked pasta: Add the drained pasta to the pan with the seafood and sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly."
10,"Optional: Stir in the fresh parsley, lemon juice (if using), and butter (if using) to the pasta and seafood mixture. Toss to combine and heat through for an additional minute."
