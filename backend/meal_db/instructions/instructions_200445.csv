1,"Pick over the dried beans and rinse them thoroughly. Soak the beans in a large bowl of cold water for at least 8 hours, or overnight."
2,"Drain the soaked beans and rinse them again."
3,"In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, combine the beans, chicken pieces, duck confit legs (if using), sliced sausage, onion, carrot, celery, garlic cloves, thyme, bay leaves, chicken broth, and red wine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1.5-2 hours, or until the beans are tender."
4,"While the beans are simmering, preheat oven to 325Â°F."

7,"In a small skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Set aside."
