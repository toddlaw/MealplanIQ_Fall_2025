Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare an Ice Bath: In a large bowl, prepare an ice bath with cold water and ice."
2,"Bring Water to a Boil: In a large pot, bring enough salted water to a boil over high heat." 
3,"Blanch the Greens: Carefully add the leafy greens to the boiling water. Blanch them for 1-2 minutes, or until tender-crisp. The exact cooking time will depend on the type of greens you're using."
4,"Transfer to Ice Bath: Immediately after blanching, transfer the greens to the prepared ice bath to stop the cooking process and preserve their bright color."
5,"Drain and Squeeze:  Let the greens cool completely in the ice bath for a few minutes. Drain the greens well and use your hands to gently squeeze out as much excess water as possible."
6,"Prepare the Dressing: In a small saucepan, combine the dashi stock, mirin, and soy sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.  **Optional:** You can reduce the dressing slightly for a more concentrated flavor by simmering for a few minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let the dressing cool completely."
7,"Arrange the Greens: Arrange the blanched and squeezed greens on a serving plate."
8,"Pour the Dressing: Pour the cooled dressing evenly over the greens."
9,"Garnish and Serve: Garnish with your choice of bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and sesame seeds (white or black) to taste. Serve Ohitashi cold or at room temperature."
10,"Tips: You can adjust the amount of soy sauce in the dressing to your preference for a stronger or milder flavor. Leftover Ohitashi can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The texture and color may change slightly."
