1,"Combine water and rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the water is absorbed, approximately 20 minutes. Set aside."

Combine the cooked rice, salt, and sugar; continue cooking and stirring occasionally until everything is well mixed, about 5 minutes. Incorporate the beaten egg until the rice is coated.
