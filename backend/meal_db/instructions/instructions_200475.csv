1,"Preheat your oven to 375°F."
2,"In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes."
3,"Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant."
4,"Add the chopped red and green bell peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until softened."
5,"Increase the heat to medium-high and add the sliced mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their liquid and begin to brown."
6,"Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), and water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to thicken the sauce."
7,"While the sauce simmers, in a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, ½ cup of the grated Parmesan cheese, and a splash of milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This is your cheese mixture."
8,"In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining milk with a tablespoon of melted butter (optional) to create a milk mixture."
9,"If using no-boil lasagna noodles, follow the package instructions for pre-cooking, if necessary. If using traditional lasagna noodles, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water."
10,"Assemble the lasagna in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread a thin layer of vegetable sauce on the bottom of the dish."
11,"Top with a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles."
12,"Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Scatter half of the chopped spinach evenly over the cheese mixture."
13,"Sprinkle with half of the shredded mozzarella cheese."
14,"Repeat layers of vegetable sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, spinach, and mozzarella cheese, ending with a layer of vegetable sauce and the remaining mozzarella cheese."
15,"Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese over the top layer of mozzarella cheese."
16,"Pour the milk mixture evenly over the top layer of cheese."
17,"Bake the lasagna for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are bubbling and the cheese is golden brown."
18,"Let the lasagna cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to set and prevents it from falling apart."
19,"Optional: Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves before serving."
