Step,Instruction
A,"For the Filling"
1, "In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, shredded cabbage, julienned carrots, and bean sprouts."
2, "Add the minced garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), sesame oil, sugar, and black pepper to the bowl. Mix well to combine."
3, "In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Add the cornstarch slurry to the filling mixture and stir to incorporate."
B,"Wrapping the Spring Rolls"
4, "Fill a shallow dish with warm water. This will be used to moisten the spring roll wrappers."
5, "Lay a spring roll wrapper flat on a clean work surface. Place a spoonful of the filling mixture near one corner of the wrapper, diagonally."
6, "Fold the bottom corner of the wrapper over the filling, then fold in the sides like a burrito. Brush the top corner with water to seal."
7, "Continue rolling the spring roll tightly, gently pressing out any air pockets as you go. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling."
C,"Frying the Spring Rolls"
8, "Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350Â°F. You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of dough in the oil - it should sizzle and start to float within seconds."
9, "Fry the spring rolls in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
10, "Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried spring rolls to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
D,"Serving"
11, "Serve the spring rolls hot with your favorite dipping sauces like sweet and sour sauce, duck sauce, or hoisin sauce. You can also garnish with chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro (optional)."
