Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the fillings: Thinly slice the cucumber lengthwise using a vegetable peeler or mandoline for even slices."
2,"Prepare the rolling station: Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. This will prevent the rice from sticking to the mat."
3,"Assemble the roll: Place half of the nori seaweed sheet on the plastic-wrapped bamboo mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin and even layer of cooked sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Dip your fingers in water to prevent sticking as you spread the rice."
4,"Add the filling: Arrange the cucumber slices in a single layer horizontally across the center of the rice, overlapping slightly. You can use more or less cucumber depending on your preference."
5,"Optional shiso leaves: If using shiso leaves, place them on top of the cucumber slices before rolling."
6,"Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, carefully lift the bottom edge of the mat over the filling. Gently roll the mat forward, applying light pressure to form a tight cylinder. Use the plastic wrap to help you shape the roll and seal the edge."
7,"Shape and cut: Once rolled, remove the bamboo mat and plastic wrap. Moisten a sharp knife with water and cut the roll into 6-8 even pieces."
8,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle the cucumber roll pieces with white sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
9,"Serve: Enjoy your cucumber roll with wasabi paste and pickled ginger (optional)!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"This recipe features a simple cucumber filling, but you can add a thin layer of cream cheese or mayonnaise for extra flavor."
2,"Shiso leaves add a unique peppery flavor to the roll, but they are optional."
3,"Wetting your fingers with water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while spreading."
4,"If you don't have a bamboo sushi mat, you can use a parchment paper sheet instead."
