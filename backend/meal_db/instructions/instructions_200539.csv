1,"Slice the steak into thin strips against the grain. This means cutting across the muscle fibers for the most tender fajitas."
2,"In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, chili powder, garlic cloves, salt, and black pepper. Whisk together to create a marinade."
3,"Add the sliced steak to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight for deeper flavor."
4,"Heat a large skillet or grill pan over high heat. If using a grill pan, lightly oil the ridges."
5,"While the pan heats, remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade."
6,"Saut√© the sliced bell peppers and red onion in the hot pan for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and slightly charred."
7,"Remove the vegetables from the pan and set them aside on a plate."
8,"Increase the heat to high and add the marinated steak. Sear the steak for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired doneness (rare, medium-rare, medium, etc.)."
9,"Once cooked, remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes on a cutting board tented with foil. This allows the juices to redistribute for a more tender result."
10,"Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave for a few seconds until softened and pliable."
11,"Slice the rested steak thinly against the grain again."
12,"To assemble the fajitas, spread some warmed tortillas with your desired toppings (cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cilantro). Add a portion of seasoned steak and vegetables. Roll up the tortillas and enjoy!"
