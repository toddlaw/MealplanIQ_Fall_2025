1,"Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Alternatively, preheat oven to 350°F if not using pre-heated enchilada sauce."
2,"Warm tortillas in the hot oil for a few seconds per side, just until softened and pliable. Alternatively, wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30-60 seconds to soften."
3,"Optional (if using raw enchilada sauce): In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add flour and whisk to form a roux. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Cook for another minute until fragrant. Gradually whisk in chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly. If using diced tomatoes or green chilies, add them in this step."
4,"Pour about 1 cup of enchilada sauce (store-bought or homemade) into a 9x13 inch baking dish and spread to coat the bottom. Season with salt and pepper to taste (optional)."
5,"Lay a softened tortilla flat. Sprinkle with a generous amount of shredded cheese (about 1/3 cup). Roll up tightly and place seam side down in the prepared baking dish."
6,"Repeat step 5 with remaining tortillas and cheese. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the rolled tortillas, ensuring they are mostly covered."
7,"Optional (if using raw enchilada sauce): Preheat oven to 350°F if not already preheated."
8,"Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the enchiladas are heated through."
9,"Let cool slightly before serving. Garnish with your desired toppings (sour cream, chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, cilantro, guacamole, etc.)."
