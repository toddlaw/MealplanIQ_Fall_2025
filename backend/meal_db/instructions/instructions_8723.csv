Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly coat a baking sheet with grease."
2,"In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Cut the butter into the mixture using a fork or pastry blender. In a small bowl, mix the milk and molasses, then stir into the flour mixture until itï¿½s moistened. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly. Roll the dough into a 1/2 inch thick round, cut out circles with a medium biscuit cutter, and place the pieces on the prepared baking sheet so they are just barely touching."
3,"Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly before serving. To achieve soft scones, cover with a dry cloth for 10 minutes. For crisp scones, do not cover."
4,"If you want to experiment with treacle, you can purchase black treacle online or at larger supermarkets."
