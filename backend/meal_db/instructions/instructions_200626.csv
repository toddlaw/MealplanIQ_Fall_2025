**Prepare the Tofu:**

1. "**Drain the Tofu:**  Unwrap the block of tofu and carefully drain any excess liquid. Gently press the tofu between paper towels to remove additional moisture. This helps achieve a crispier texture."

2. **Cut the Tofu:**  Cut the tofu block into 8-12 even slices or squares, depending on your desired serving size."

**Prepare the Dredge:**

3. "**Dredge in Potato Starch:** Place the potato starch in a shallow dish. Dredge each tofu piece thoroughly in the potato starch, coating all sides evenly. Shake off any excess starch."

**Fry the Tofu:**

4. "**Heat Oil:** Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 340°F (170°C). You can check the temperature with a thermometer or by dropping a small piece of dredged tofu; it should sizzle and float to the surface within seconds."

5. "**Fry in Batches:** Fry the tofu pieces in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and lowering the oil temperature. Carefully lower the dredged tofu pieces into the hot oil."

6. "**Fry Until Golden:** Fry the tofu for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside."

7. "**Drain and Transfer:** Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried tofu to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil."

**Make the Tsuyu Sauce:**

8. "**Combine Sauce Ingredients:** In a small saucepan, combine the dashi stock, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat."

9. "**Simmer and Season:** Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes, or until slightly reduced and the flavors meld. Taste and adjust the seasoning with a pinch of salt, if desired."

**Assemble and Serve:**

10. "**Arrange Tofu:**  Arrange the fried tofu pieces in shallow serving bowls."

11. "**Add Hot Sauce:**  Pour a ladleful of the hot tsuyu sauce over the tofu in each bowl."

12. "**Garnish (Optional):**  Garnish with your choice of grated daikon radish, chopped green onions, shiso leaves (optional), myoga ginger (optional), or bonito flakes (optional)."

13. "**Serve Hot:** Serve the agedashi tofu hot immediately. Enjoy!**"

**Tips:**

* You can use an air fryer for a healthier alternative to deep-frying the tofu. Follow your air fryer's instructions for cooking time and temperature.
* Leftover agedashi tofu can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.  However, the texture may become softer. You can reheat them gently in the leftover tsuyu sauce over low heat until warmed through.
