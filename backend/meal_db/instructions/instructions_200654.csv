1,"Prepare the Brine: In a large pot, combine water and coarse sea salt. Bring the brine to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool completely."
2,"Cut the Napa cabbage into quarters. Submerge the cabbage quarters in the cooled brine, ensuring they are completely covered. Weigh them down with a plate or other heavy object to keep them submerged. Brine for 6-8 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator."
3,"After brining, remove the cabbage quarters from the brine and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Pat them dry with a clean cloth or paper towels."
4,"Prepare the Kimchi Paste: In a large bowl, combine Korean shrimp paste (saeujeot), fish sauce, gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), minced garlic, and minced ginger. If using, add julienned Korean radish and pear. Adjust the amount of gochugaru depending on your desired spice preference."
5,"Cut the scallions into 2-inch pieces. Add them to the kimchi paste along with Â¾ cup of water. Mix well to create a thick paste."
6,"Assemble the Kimchi: Spread the kimchi paste evenly between the leaves of each cabbage quarter, ensuring it reaches the core. Wear gloves if working with a lot of gochugaru to avoid burning your hands."
7,"Place the stuffed cabbage quarters in a non-reactive container (glass or ceramic is ideal). Tightly seal the container and let it ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days."
8,"After 1-2 days, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator. The kimchi will continue to mature and develop flavor over time. It's best enjoyed after at least a few days of refrigeration, but can be stored for several weeks."
9,"To Serve: Cut or tear off pieces of kimchi and enjoy as a side dish or wrap it in lettuce leaves with cooked pork belly (bossam) and other condiments for a delicious Korean meal."
