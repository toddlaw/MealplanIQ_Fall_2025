1,"Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, about 1-inch cubes."
2,"In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat vegetable oil over medium heat."
3,"Add the potato pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown on all sides (around 10-15 minutes)."
4,"Add water, soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (if using) to the pot. Stir to combine and bring to a boil."
5,"Lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork."
6,"While the potatoes simmer, prepare the optional Korean pear slices. If using, cut the pear into thin wedges or matchsticks."
7,"After 15-20 minutes, add the Korean pear slices (if using) and minced garlic to the pot. Simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the pears are slightly softened (be careful not to overcook them)."
8,"Once the potatoes are tender and the braising liquid has reduced slightly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You can add a pinch of black pepper for extra flavor (optional)."
9,"Turn off the heat and stir in sesame oil. Gently toss the potatoes to coat them evenly."
10,"Transfer the Gamja Jorim to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds and serve hot or at room temperature as a side dish with Korean meals."
