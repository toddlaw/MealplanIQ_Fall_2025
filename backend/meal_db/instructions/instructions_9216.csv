1,"Place two slices of bacon at the bottom of a large pot. Add a layer of cabbage on top. Lightly dust with flour and add a pinch of caraway seeds. Season with some salt and pepper. Continue layering in this manner until the pot is filled."
2,"Fill the pot with enough water to reach about 3/4 of the way up the sides. Bring to a boil and cook for approximately 45 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool slightly, then mix in the vinegar and sugar. Use your discretion to add sugar carefully to adjust to your taste. The goal is to find a balance between sweet and sour, which is the key."
3,"Use a head of cabbage that has been stored in your refrigerator for some time; avoid using a fresh cabbage. Why? The older cabbage tends to hold up better during cooking. There are benefits to aging."
4,"A flavorful sausage, sliced, or a smoked pork hock can also replace the bacon, but it should contain some fat and flavor. Occasionally, I add a few bouillon cubes as well."
