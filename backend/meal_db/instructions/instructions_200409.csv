1,"In a large bowl or container, whisk together the buttermilk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Submerge the chicken pieces in the buttermilk marinade, ensuring they are completely covered. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight, for maximum flavor and tenderness."
2,"In another large bowl or shallow dish, whisk together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Season generously with salt and black pepper."
3,"Heat enough vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches. Aim for a temperature between 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit (175-190 degrees Celsius). Use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the oil temperature accurately."
4,"Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dredge each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour mixture, coating it evenly on all sides. Gently shake off any excess flour."
5,"Carefully lower the floured chicken pieces into the hot oil, one or two at a time to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry for 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside, and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) in the thickest part of the chicken, as measured with a food thermometer."
6,"Transfer the fried chicken pieces to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
7,"Repeat steps 4-6 with the remaining chicken pieces, adjusting the oil temperature as needed to maintain around 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)."
8,"Let the fried chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat for a more flavorful and tender result."
9,"Enjoy your delicious homemade fried chicken! Serve with your favorite dipping sauces like hot sauce, honey mustard, or ranch dressing."
