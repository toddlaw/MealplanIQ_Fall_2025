Step,Instruction
1,"Mix 2 cups bread flour, warm water, yeast, and salt with a dough hook attachment on an electric mixer. Blend on low speed until combined but moist for around 2 minutes. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, approximately 20 minutes."
2,"Mix the ingredients together in a bowl using an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment on low speed until well combined and moist. Let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 20 minutes, then mix on low speed for about 5 minutes. Gradually add the remaining flour until a soft, sticky dough is formed."
3,"Continue mixing the dough on medium speed until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 8 minutes. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rest for approximately 20 minutes."
4,Rub the plastic container evenly with olive oil in the meantime.
5,Knead the dough briefly on a floured surface until soft but still slightly moist. Shape into a ball and place it in the oiled container. Refrigerate for at least 1 day and up to 7 days.
6,"You may not need to use all the flour as you aim for a soft, sticky dough. Add flour gradually and avoid it becoming too dry, as a softer dough is preferred."
7,"This recipe can be used to make two 12-inch thin-crust pizzas as well, if preferred."
8,"Make pizza: Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Place a baking stone or heavy pan on the bottom rack. Allow the dough to come to room temperature until wet and stretchy. Stretch the dough onto a pizza pan, add toppings, then transfer to the hot stone. Bake until edges are browned, about 10-15 minutes."
