1,"Put the jalape�os in a saucepan and cover them with enough water. Bring it to a boil. Simmer until the jalape�os become soft and start to lose their luster, around 10 to 12 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the jalape�os, cut off the stems, and transfer them to a blender. Boil the tomatoes for 2 to 3 minutes to help loosen their skin. Remove the skins from the tomatoes and add them to the blender as well."
2,"Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and taste, adjusting seasoning as needed."
