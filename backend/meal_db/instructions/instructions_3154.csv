1,"Combine the rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and let it simmer until the rice is soft and the liquid has been absorbed, which should take about 20 to 25 minutes. Once cooked, spread the rice onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator until cooled, approximately 20 minutes."
2,"Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the green onions, ham, and peas to the hot oil, cooking and stirring until the onions are tender, about 2 minutes. Incorporate the pineapple chunks into the wok; cook until the pineapple starts to darken, about 2 minutes. Shift the ingredients to one side of the wok and pour the beaten egg into the center. Cook until the egg starts to set, around 30 seconds. Mix all the ingredients together in the wok."
3,"Combine the cooled rice, sugar, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder in the wok; continuously stir to prevent sticking. Cook until warmed through, approximately 3 minutes. Drizzle the rice with soy sauce and mix well."
4,"Vegetable oil can be used in place of sesame oil for stir-frying. To prevent the rice from sticking, ensure the wok is extremely hot and well-oiled."
