Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper."
2,"Combine white sugar, light brown sugar, evaporated milk, corn syrup, and cocoa powder in a saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a full rolling boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking while stirring constantly until the syrup reaches 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) on a candy thermometer. When dropped into cold water, a small amount of syrup should form a soft ball that flattens when taken out and set on a flat surface."
3,"Pour the mixture into the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly. Let it cool completely at room temperature before cutting into squares."
4,"Once cool, the pralines will harden and can be removed from the parchment paper."
5,"The original recipe, handed down from my mother, did not include cocoa and creates a fantastic praline. If you prefer the more traditional Mexican pralines, just omit the cocoa!"
