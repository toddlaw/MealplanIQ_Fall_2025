1,"Wash and trim the fresh okra. Slice them into 1/2 inch thick rounds or diagonal pieces."
2,"In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornmeal, paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper."
3,"In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs together until well beaten."
4,"Heat enough oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to reach 350Â°F. You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of breadcrumb in the oil - it should sizzle and turn golden brown within seconds."
5,"Dredge the okra slices in the beaten egg mixture, coating them evenly."
6,"Then, transfer the okra slices from the egg mixture to the dry breading mixture. Coat them thoroughly, shaking off any excess."
7,"Fry the okra in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
8,"Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried okra to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil."
9,"Season the fried okra with additional salt and pepper (optional) while still hot."
10,"Serve immediately. Fried okra is best enjoyed hot and crispy."
