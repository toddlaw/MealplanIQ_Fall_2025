Step,Instruction
1,"Prepare the pickling liquid: In a medium saucepan, combine the white vinegar, water, sugar, salt, black peppercorns, smashed garlic cloves, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar and salt dissolve."
2,"Optional Step:** For added flavor, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the sliced vegetables (carrots, jalapeño pepper, red onion) and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until slightly softened. This step is optional but can enhance the flavor of the vegetables."
3,"Transfer the pre-sautéed vegetables (if using) or all the raw vegetables (carrots, jalapeño pepper, red onion, cauliflower florets) to a clean glass jar."
4,"Pour the hot pickling liquid from the saucepan over the vegetables in the jar. The liquid should cover the vegetables completely. If needed, add a little extra hot water to ensure everything is submerged."
5,"Seal the jar tightly with a lid and let it cool completely to room temperature on the counter. This can take about 1-2 hours."
6,"Refrigerate the Escabeche for at least 3 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.** The pickled vegetables will continue to soften and become more flavorful the longer they sit in the brine."
7,"Serve Escabeche cold as a side dish or condiment. You can enjoy it with tacos, burritos, tostadas, or as a refreshing appetizer. Garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs (optional) for an extra pop of color and flavor."
8,"Storage: The pickled vegetables will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator in a sealed container."
