step,instruction
1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts of water)."
2,"While the water heats up, heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat."
3,"Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
4,"Do not let the garlic brown. Reduce heat to low if necessary."
5,"Add the crushed red pepper flakes according to your desired spice level. Start with ½ teaspoon for a mild sauce and adjust to taste."
6,"Stir the red pepper flakes for a few seconds to release their flavor."
7,"Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly, allowing the tomato paste to caramelize slightly."
8,"Pour in the chopped tomatoes (canned) and bring the sauce to a simmer."
9,"Season with salt and black pepper (to taste)."
10,"Reduce heat to low, cover the pot partially, and simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer, the thicker and richer the sauce will become."
11,"While the sauce simmers, add the penne pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes)."
12,"Reserve about ½ cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta completely. This starchy water can help loosen up the sauce if it becomes too thick."
13,"Once the sauce is finished simmering and the pasta is cooked, drain the pasta and add it directly to the skillet with the sauce."
14,"Toss the pasta and sauce together until well coated."
15,"If the sauce seems too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water at a time, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach a desired consistency."
16,"Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil leaves."
17,"Serve the Penne Arrabbiata immediately in warmed bowls. Garnish with additional fresh basil leaves (optional), fresh parsley leaves (optional), and grated Parmesan cheese (optional). Enjoy!"
