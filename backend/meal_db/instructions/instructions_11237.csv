1,"In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add 2 cups of flour and salt, then mix thoroughly. Gradually incorporate the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Once the dough comes together, knead it on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, for around 15 minutes. Transfer the dough to a floured bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight."

3,"Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface, dividing it into two equal portions. Allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes while you prepare your preferred pizza toppings. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)."

Add desired toppings, then bake on a pizza stone in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Allow the baked pizza to cool for 5 minutes before serving."
