Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 400°F."
2,"Clarify the Butter (Optional): If using clarified butter, you can skip this step. To clarify regular butter, melt it in a saucepan over low heat. As the butter melts, a white foamy layer will form on the surface. Keep heating until the milk solids settle at the bottom and the butter becomes clear. Carefully spoon off the clear butter, leaving the milk solids behind."
3,"Prepare the Potatoes:** Peel the russet potatoes using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife to achieve very thin and even slices (about 1/16 inch thick)."
4,"Optional Step (For Less Browning):  Soak the sliced potatoes in a large bowl of cold water for 10-15 minutes. This helps to remove some of the starch and can prevent excessive browning during baking. Drain the potatoes well and pat them dry with paper towels before using."
5,"Season the Potatoes: In a large bowl, toss the sliced potatoes with salt and freshly ground black pepper."
6,"Assemble the Pommes Anna: Heat a cast-iron skillet or oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of clarified butter (or melted regular butter) or duck fat (if using) to the pan, swirling to coat the bottom."
7,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): If using, add a few fresh thyme sprigs and/or minced garlic cloves to the hot butter and cook for a minute until fragrant. Discard the thyme sprigs (if used) before layering the potatoes."
8,"Create the First Layer: Using a single layer of potato slices, completely cover the bottom of the skillet in a circular pattern, overlapping the slices slightly. You can stand the slices on their ends for a more decorative look (optional)."
9,"Continue Layering: Add another layer of potato slices in a crisscross pattern over the first layer. Try to alternate the direction of the slices for a more stable structure."
10,"Repeat Layering: Keep layering the potato slices in a circular or crisscross pattern, using up all the potatoes. Gently press down on the layers as you go to create a compact cake."
11,"Dot the Top with Butter: Drizzle or dot the top layer of potatoes with melted butter."
12,"Bake the Pommes Anna: Place the skillet in the preheated oven and bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and golden brown on the bottom and the sides."
13,"Optional Step (For Extra Crisp): During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can increase the oven temperature to 425°F to achieve a crispier crust."
14,"Carefully Invert the Pommes Anna: Once cooked through, remove the skillet from the oven.  **Important Safety Note:** Use oven mitts and be careful as the handle will be hot. Place a large heat-resistant plate on top of the skillet. Using both hands, carefully and firmly flip the skillet and plate together to invert the Pommes Anna onto the plate."
15,"Slide the Pommes Anna Back into the Skillet: Slide the pommes anna (golden brown side up) back into the empty skillet. You can use a spatula to help guide it if needed."
16,"Optional Step (For Added Color): If the top isn't very golden brown, return the skillet with the pommes anna to the oven for a few more minutes to brown the top."
17,"Cut and Serve: Let the Pommes Anna cool slightly before cutting into wedges and serving. Enjoy as a delicious and impressive side dish!"
18,"Notes: A mandoline slicer is a recommended tool for achieving uniformly thin potato slices. Leftover Pommes Anna can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a skillet over medium heat until warmed through."
