1,"Marinate the Beef: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Heat the Wok: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan."
3,"Sear the Beef: Add the marinated beef to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through to your desired level of doneness (remove sooner for a more rare center)."
4,"Remove the Beef: Once cooked, transfer the seared beef to a plate and set aside."
5,"Prepare the Sauce: In the same wok, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
6,"Deglaze the Wok (Optional): Add a splash of chicken broth to deglaze the wok, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom (this adds extra flavor to the sauce)."
7,"Add Remaining Sauce Ingredients: Pour in the remaining chicken broth, water, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, and white pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally."
8,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl to create a slurry. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
9,"Return the Beef: Add the cooked beef back to the wok with the simmering sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the beef in the sauce."
10,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the beef."
11,"Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil. Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Chinese-style beef with garlic sauce!"
