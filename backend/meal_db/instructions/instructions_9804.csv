1,"In a small bowl, combine Dijon mustard and honey. Stir in the tarragon, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper."
2,"Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and coat both sides with the Dijon mustard mixture. Pour 1/4 cup of wine around the chicken. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced."
3,"Pour an additional 1/4 cup of wine around the chicken and keep cooking for about 5 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear. Take off the heat, saving the remaining liquid."
4,"Combine the leftover wine into the skillet. Raise the heat to medium and scrape up the browned bits. Cook and stir until the liquid has reduced by approximately one-third. Serve as a sauce over the chicken."
