step,instruction
Part A,"For the Chashu Pork"
1,"Marinate the pork: In a large pot, combine the pork belly, water to cover, chopped green onions, smashed garlic, sliced ginger, soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, and honey. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until the pork is tender and flavorful. Let the pork cool in the marinade for at least 30 minutes before slicing thinly."
Part B,"For the Shio Tare (Flavoring Sauce)"
2,"Make the dashi: In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, soaked shiitake mushrooms (reserve soaking liquid), kombu seaweed, and additional water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, then remove and discard the kombu seaweed. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the shiitake mushrooms and any solids."
3,"Optional bonito flakes: If using, add the bonito flakes to the strained broth and let them steep for 5 minutes. Then, strain the broth again to remove the bonito flakes."
4,"Season the broth: Season the broth with sea salt to taste. Start with 1/2 tablespoon and adjust gradually until you reach the desired level of salinity."
Part C,"Assemble the Ramen"
5,"Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse briefly with hot water."
6,"Heat the broth: Bring the seasoned shio tare broth back to a simmer over medium heat."
7,"Assemble the bowls: Divide the cooked ramen noodles between two serving bowls. Top each bowl with sliced chashu pork (if using), ajitsuke tamago halves (if using), and a sheet of nori seaweed."
8,"Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and toppings."
9,"Garnish (optional): Garnish with sliced green onions, bamboo shoots, corn, a drizzle of sesame oil, or your favorite ramen toppings."
10,"Serve: Enjoy your shio ramen hot and flavorful!"
Part D,"Notes"
1,"Chashu pork is a delicious marinated pork belly topping for ramen. You can skip this step if you prefer a simpler ramen or use pre-made chashu pork."
2,"Shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed add depth of flavor to the broth. You can substitute with pre-made dashi powder if unavailable."
3,"Bonito flakes add a subtle umami flavor to the broth, but they are optional."
4,"Adjust the amount of sea salt to your taste preference for a saltier or lighter shio ramen."
