Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat your oven to 375°F."
2,"Prepare the Potatoes: Peel the russet potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife, thinly slice the potatoes into rounds about 1/8 inch thick. Aim for uniform slices for even cooking."
3,"Optional Step (For Extra Flavor): In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the potato slices for 2-3 minutes. This step helps to remove some of the starch and can lead to a creamier gratin (optional). Drain the potatoes well and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process.
4,"Gently Season the Milk: In a large saucepan, combine the milk, heavy cream, grated nutmeg, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the mixture over medium heat until simmering, but do not let it boil. Remove the pan from the heat."
5,"Prep the Baking Dish: Generously grease a baking dish (around 9x13 inch) with butter. Arrange a single layer of potato slices in the bottom of the dish, overlapping slightly."
6,"Pour enough of the warmed milk mixture over the potato layer to just barely cover them. Sprinkle with a mixture of shredded Gruyère cheese and Parmesan cheese."
7,"Repeat the layering process, alternating potato slices, milk mixture, and cheese, until all the ingredients are used. Make sure the top layer is covered in cheese."
8,"Bake the Gratin: Bake the gratin dauphinois in the preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and cooked through, and the top is golden brown and bubbly."
9,"Optional Step (For a Crispier Top): During the last 5-7 minutes of baking, you can switch the oven to broil to achieve a crispier cheese topping on the gratin (watch closely to avoid burning)."
10,"Let the gratin dauphinois rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the gratin to set and prevents it from being too runny."
11,"Serve the gratin dauphinois hot as a delicious and comforting side dish. Enjoy!"
