Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the vegetables: Dice the onion, zucchini, and potato (if using). Chop the scallions for garnish."
2,"Cook the ground pork: In a large wok or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the ground pork and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spatula, for about 5 minutes."
3,"Sauté the vegetables: Add the diced onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened."
4,"Add the zucchini and potato (if using): Stir in the diced zucchini and potato (if using) and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened."
5,"Stir in the chunjang: Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the chunjang (Korean black bean paste) to the center. Sauté the chunjang for 1 minute, stirring constantly to release the fragrance and prevent burning."
6,"Incorporate the vegetables and broth: Mix the chunjang with the cooked vegetables and ground pork. Pour in the chicken broth and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer for 5-7 minutes."
7,"Season and thicken the sauce: Add sugar to taste. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry. Gradually stir the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce until it thickens slightly. You can adjust the thickness by adding more cornstarch slurry or water as needed."
8,"Cook the noodles: While the sauce simmers, cook the Korean black bean noodles (jjajangmyeon noodles) according to package instructions. They usually cook in boiling water for 4-5 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold running water to stop the cooking process."
9,"Assemble and serve: Divide the cooked noodles among bowls. Ladle the hot black bean sauce over the noodles. Garnish with chopped scallions and serve hot. Enjoy!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"You can adjust the amount of sugar to your taste preference."
2,"Feel free to omit the potato or substitute it with other vegetables like carrots or green beans."
3,"If the sauce becomes too thick, simply add a little more water or broth to thin it out."
