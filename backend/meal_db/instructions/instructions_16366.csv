1,"Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 10-inch tube pan by lining the bottom with parchment paper (do not grease the paper). Separate the eggs when they are cold, but allow them to come to room temperature before starting the cake batter."
2,"Beat egg yolks in a large bowl until thick and lemon colored. Beat egg whites and salt in another bowl until foamy. Gradually add sifted powdered sugar to egg whites, beating until stiff but not dry. Gently fold 1/3 of the whites into the yolks, then fold in the remaining whites. Carefully fold ground pecans into the egg mixture."
3,"Bake the cake in the oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 50 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean and the top is lightly browned. Once done, remove from the oven and invert the pan to cool. Ensure the cake is completely cooled before removing it from the pan."
4,Grind the pecans finely until they resemble flour. Approximately 6 cups of shelled ground pecans are needed to yield 3 cups ground. Ground nuts should not be frozen.
