Step,Instruction
1,"Combine self-rising flour, sugar, eggs, evaporated milk, and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Continuously whisk the mixture while bringing it to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook while whisking until the pudding thickens, around 15 to 20 minutes."
2,Incorporate margarine and vanilla extract into the thickened pudding until well mixed.
3,"Let the pudding sit off the heat to cool for about 10 minutes, then sprinkle with cinnamon and enjoy while warm."
4,You may use 3 cups of regular milk as a substitute for evaporated milk if you prefer to make plain pudding.
5,"When preparing this recipe, I recycle the used PET Milk can as a water measure by filling it, which is slightly less than a cup."
6,"My grandmother recommends waiting for the mixture to firm up and cook thoroughly before adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter, but I tend to be less patient. Cooking usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes until the texture thickens like oatmeal."
