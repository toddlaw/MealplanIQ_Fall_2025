1,"Mix yeast with warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 3 cups of flour (dough should be soft and slightly sticky). Knead for 5 minutes, about 200 turns on a lightly floured board. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes."
2,"Cut the dough in half and shape each piece into a 12x7 inch rectangle. Spread 1 tablespoon of softened butter on each half, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Roll up each half, starting from the wider side, and seal by pinching the seams. Slice each roll into 12 pieces."
3,"Prepare two 9-inch round cake pans by coating each with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Arrange 12 dough slices in each pan, leaving some space between them. Allow dough to rise until doubled in size."
