1,"Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat."
2,"Add the thinly sliced onions. Season with salt, sugar, and black pepper. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent."
3,"Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for an additional 20-40 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions are deeply golden brown and caramelized. Be patient with this step, as it takes time to achieve the desired level of caramelization."
4,"Add the thyme sprigs and cook for an additional minute, stirring to release the flavor of the thyme."
5,"Pour in the beef broth and sherry or white wine (if using). Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot."
6,"Add the bay leaf and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld."
7,"Preheat your oven to broil with the rack in the upper third position."
8,"While the soup simmers, toast the bread slices. You can toast them in a toaster, under the broiler, or in a skillet with a little butter."
9,"Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs from the soup."
10,"Ladle the hot soup into oven-safe bowls. Top each bowl with a toasted bread slice."
11,"Divide the shredded Gruyère cheese evenly among the bowls, covering the bread completely."
12,"Broil for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. You can also use a kitchen torch to achieve this effect."
13,"Optional: Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top of the melted Gruyère cheese for an extra layer of flavor (optional)."
14,"Serve the French onion soup immediately, while the cheese is hot and bubbly. Enjoy!"
