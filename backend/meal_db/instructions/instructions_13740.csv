Then I sprinkled some salt, pepper and garlic powder on top of the potatoes, pricked them a few times with a fork, wrapped them in foil and cooked them about 2 hours at 325 degrees. They were very yummy,"" shared <a data-component=""link"" data-ordinal=""1"" data-source=""inlineLink"" data-type=""internalLink"" href=""https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/10801811"">Jennifer Storemski</a>."

""You could mess up this potato! Prior to cooking, I microwaved the two large potatoes for 5 minutes as a precaution to expedite the process since they were quite large. After increasing the temperature to 350 degrees F, I placed them directly on the top oven rack without foil, and they turned out perfectly after 45 minutes!
