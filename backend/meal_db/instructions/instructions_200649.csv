1,"Wash and trim the ends of the zucchini. Cut the zucchini into thin julienne strips or matchsticks. You can use a julienne peeler or mandoline for easier and more uniform cutting."
2,"Heat neutral oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini strips and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly softened but still crisp-tender."
3,"Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, or until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic."
4,"Add gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) to the pan and stir to coat the zucchini. Adjust the amount based on your desired spice level."
5,"Pour in soy sauce and sesame oil. Toss the zucchini to ensure even distribution of the seasonings."
6,"Cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the zucchini is heated through and the sauce thickens slightly."
7,"Turn off the heat and season with salt to taste. Be mindful of the saltiness from the soy sauce when adding salt."
8,"Transfer the Hobak Namul to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds and thinly sliced scallions (optional) and serve at room temperature or slightly chilled as a side dish with Korean meals."
