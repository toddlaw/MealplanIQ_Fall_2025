step,instruction
1,"Trim any excess fat from the pork shoulder. Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces."
2,"Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering."
3,"Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (about 5 minutes)."
4,"Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Do not brown."
5,"Stir in cumin, chili powder, oregano, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute to release the fragrance of the spices."
6,"Add the pork pieces, chicken broth, and apple cider vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 2-2.5 hours, or until the pork is very tender and easily shreds with two forks."
7,"While the pork cooks, warm flour tortillas according to package instructions (microwave, stovetop, etc.). You can also wrap them in foil and heat in a warm oven (200Â°F) for 5-10 minutes."
8,"Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the pot with a slotted spoon and shred it with two forks. Discard any large pieces of fat."
9,"Optional: To crisp the pork, increase the heat to medium and return the shredded pork to the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the edges of the pork start to brown."
10,"Assemble burritos by laying a warmed tortilla flat. Spread a layer of shredded pork down the center. Top with your desired fillings (rice, beans, lettuce, etc.) and sprinkle with shredded cheese."
11,"Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up and over the filling. Then fold in the sides, like a business letter. Roll the burrito tightly, starting from the bottom."
12,"Optional: You can wrap the burrito in foil to keep it warm and secure the shape."
13,"Serve immediately and enjoy with your favorite toppings (sour cream, guacamole, salsa, etc.)."
