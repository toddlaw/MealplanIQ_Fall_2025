Step,Instruction
1,"Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 400Â°F. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil or coat with nonstick cooking spray."
2,"Prepare the Potatoes: Wash and dry the potatoes. Cut them into 1-inch cubes or wedges, depending on your preference."
3,"Season the Potatoes: In a large bowl, toss the potato cubes or wedges with olive oil, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Ensure all the potatoes are evenly coated."
4.,"Roast the Potatoes: Spread the seasoned potato pieces in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Avoid overcrowding the pan, as this will prevent them from crisping properly."
5,"Roast the Garlic (Optional): If using whole garlic cloves, separate the cloves from the head but leave the skin on. Drizzle them with a little olive oil and toss them with the potatoes on the baking sheet."
6,"Bake: Bake the potatoes in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and golden brown on the outside.  Optional: If using whole garlic cloves, roast them for the entire baking time, or until they are soft and tender."
7,"Flip the Potatoes (Optional): For extra crispy edges, use a spatula to gently flip the potatoes halfway through the baking time."
8,"Garlic Mash (Optional): Once the garlic cloves are soft and roasted, remove them from the baking sheet and carefully squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins. Mash the roasted garlic cloves with a fork and stir them back into the roasted potatoes for added flavor."
9,"Serve and Enjoy:  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and garnish the roasted potatoes with chopped fresh parsley (optional). Serve hot as a delicious side dish."
