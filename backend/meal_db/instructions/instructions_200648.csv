1,"Drain the tofu block and press out any excess moisture. You can press the tofu by placing it between two clean kitchen towels and weighing it down with a heavy object for 15-20 minutes."
2,"Cut the tofu block into bite-sized pieces. Slab or cube shapes are both common."
3,"Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat."
4,"Carefully add the tofu pieces to the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown on all sides."
5,"Pour in the water, soy sauce, sugar, and Korean broth (if using) to the pan. Stir to combine and bring to a boil."
6,"Lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the tofu absorbs the braising liquid and becomes tender."
7,"While the tofu simmers, prepare the scallions. Cut them into 1-inch pieces."
8,"After 15-20 minutes, add the scallions and minced garlic to the pan. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes."
9,"Optionally, add a pinch to 1 teaspoon of gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) for a spicy kick. Adjust the amount depending on your spice preference."
10,"Once the tofu is tender and the braising liquid has reduced slightly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You can add a pinch of black pepper for extra flavor (optional)."
11,"Turn off the heat and stir in sesame oil. Gently toss the tofu to coat them evenly."
12,"Transfer the Dubu Jorim to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds and serve hot or at room temperature as a side dish with Korean meals."
