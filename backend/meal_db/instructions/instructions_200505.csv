Part A,"Main Recipe"
1,"Prepare the fillings: Julienne the cucumber and thinly slice the avocado."
2,"Prepare the rolling station: Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. This will prevent the rice from sticking to the mat."
3,"Assemble the roll: Place half of the nori seaweed sheet on the plastic-wrapped bamboo mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin and even layer of cooked sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Dip your fingers in water to prevent sticking as you spread the rice."
4,"Add the filling: Arrange a line of julienned cucumber in the center of the rice, closer to the bottom edge."
5,"Optional creamy avocado filling: In a small bowl, mash half of the sliced avocado with mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce (to taste) to create a creamy spread. Spread this mixture next to the cucumber line."
6,"Add remaining avocado slices: Top the creamy avocado mixture (or cucumber if not using) with the remaining thinly sliced avocado."
7,"Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, carefully lift the bottom edge of the mat over the filling. Gently roll the mat forward, applying light pressure to form a tight cylinder. Use the plastic wrap to help you shape the roll and seal the edge."
8,"Shape and cut: Once rolled, remove the bamboo mat and plastic wrap. Moisten a sharp knife with water and cut the roll into 6-8 even pieces."
9,"Garnish (optional): Sprinkle the avocado roll pieces with white sesame seeds for extra flavor and presentation."
10,"Serve: Enjoy your avocado roll with wasabi paste and pickled ginger (optional)!"
Part B,"Notes"
1,"This recipe offers a classic avocado roll with cucumber, but you can customize the fillings with additional options like carrots or pickled vegetables."
2,"The creamy avocado filling with mayonnaise and Sriracha is optional. You can omit it for a simpler avocado and cucumber roll."
3,"Wetting your fingers with water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while spreading."
4,"If you don't have a bamboo sushi mat, you can use a parchment paper sheet instead."
