1,"Wash and trim the broccoli. Cut the broccoli florets into bite-sized pieces and the stalks into thin slices."
2,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant and slightly golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic."
3,"Optional: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the pan for a touch of heat. Stir for a few seconds to release the flavor."
4,"Add the broccoli florets and stalks to the pan. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."
5,"Pour in a splash of water (about 1/4 cup) to the pan. This will help steam the broccoli while it cooks."
6,"Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender-crisp. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking."
7,"Uncover the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the broccoli is slightly browned and crispy in some spots."
8,"Squeeze in the fresh lemon juice and stir to coat the broccoli."
9,"**Optional:** Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the cooked broccoli for a cheesy flavor, if desired."
10,"Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped fresh parsley (optional)."
11,"Serve the garlic broccoli hot as a side dish or enjoy it on its own."
12,"Notes: This recipe yields approximately 2-3 servings. You can adjust the amount of garlic and red pepper flakes to your preference. If you don't have a lid for your pan, you can use a piece of aluminum foil to cover it while steaming the broccoli. Leftover garlic broccoli can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or microwave until warmed through, but the broccoli may lose some crispness."
