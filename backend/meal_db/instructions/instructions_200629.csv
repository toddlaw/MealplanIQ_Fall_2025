1,"Whisk the Eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, mirin, soy sauce, sugar, and dashi stock (if using) until well combined. Season with a pinch of salt to taste. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any stray egg whites for a smoother texture (optional)."
2,"Prepare the Pan: Heat a non-stick tamagoyaki pan (or a regular non-stick pan) over medium-low heat. Add a few drops of vegetable oil and spread it evenly with a paper towel to coat the bottom of the pan."
3,"Cook the First Layer: Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the heated pan, tilting the pan to spread the egg evenly." 
4,"Optional Additions: While the first layer is still slightly wet, sprinkle on your desired chopped scallions, shredded cooked vegetables, or shredded cheese (optional)."
5,"Lift and Fold: As the edges of the omelette begin to set, gently lift them with a heat-resistant spatula and roll them towards the center of the pan."
6,"Add More Egg Mixture: Add a small amount of the remaining egg mixture to the empty pan, tilting the pan again to distribute the egg evenly."
7,"Repeat Folding: Allow the new layer to cook slightly, then use your spatula to push the cooked omelette roll towards the far end of the pan. Pour another small amount of egg mixture into the empty space in the pan."
8,"Continue Rolling:  Let the new layer set slightly, then lift the edge of the cooked omelette roll and fold it over the new layer. Repeat steps 6 and 7, adding more egg mixture and rolling the omelette as you go, until all the egg mixture is used."
9,"Shape the Omelette: Once all the egg mixture is cooked, use your spatula to gently shape the omelette roll into a cylindrical shape. Cook for an additional 30 seconds to a minute to ensure everything is cooked through."
10,"Transfer and Cool: Transfer the cooked tamagoyaki to a cutting board lined with a sheet of bamboo mat (makisu) or a clean kitchen towel. Use the mat or towel to gently roll the omelette into a tighter cylinder, applying light pressure to form a uniform shape. Let the tamagoyaki cool slightly for a few minutes."
11,"Slice and Serve: Unroll the tamagoyaki carefully and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Serve warm or at room temperature. Tamagoyaki can be enjoyed on its own or as part of a bento box lunch."
A,"Tips:"
1,"Use a non-stick pan for easier flipping and rolling."
2,"Use low heat to ensure the eggs cook evenly throughout without burning."
3,"Don't overcook the egg mixture. You want the omelette to be cooked through but still slightly moist on the inside."
4,"Practice makes perfect! Don't be discouraged if your first attempt at tamagoyaki isn't perfect. The more you practice, the better you'll become at rolling it."
