1,"Remove the steaks from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. This will ensure even cooking."
2,"Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season generously with kosher salt and black pepper on both sides."
3,"Heat a large cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and let it shimmer."
4,"Sear the steaks for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time depending on your desired level of doneness (rare: 2-3 minutes per side; medium: 4-5 minutes per side; medium-well: 5-6 minutes per side)."
5,"Once seared, transfer the steaks to a plate and tent them loosely with foil to let them rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat for a more tender and flavorful steak."
6,"While the steaks rest, prepare the fries. Peel the potatoes and cut them into even-sized sticks (about ½ inch thick and 2-3 inches long)."
7,"Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 325°F. You can also use a deep pot with a heavy bottom filled with enough oil to come halfway up the sides."
8,"Optional for double-frying (recommended for crispier fries): Fry the potatoes in batches for 2-3 minutes, or until they are softened but not browned. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Once all the potatoes are par-fried, increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C)."
9,"Single fry method (if not double-frying): Fry the potatoes in batches for 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot, as this can lower the oil temperature and result in soggy fries."
10,"While the last batch of fries cooks, add the garlic cloves and thyme sprigs (if using) to the pan used to cook the steaks. Heat for a minute or two, until fragrant."
11,"**Optional:** Add a tablespoon of butter (optional) to the pan with the garlic and thyme. Swirl to combine and let it melt, adding a nutty flavor to the fries."
12,"Once the fries are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season them immediately with salt while they are hot."
13,"Plate the rested steak, top with a sprig of rosemary for garnish (optional), and serve alongside the hot and crispy fries. Enjoy!"
