1,"Add the ground beef to a large skillet heated over medium-high. Season with garlic powder and oregano, and cook while breaking it apart until browned and no longer pink. Drain any excess grease, then lower the heat to medium-low and incorporate the refried beans and salsa. Cook until warmed throughout."
2,"Warm the flour tortillas in the microwave for 2 minutes, or until they are pliable. Place 1/4 cup of the beef mixture in the center, add shredded cheese on top, and roll them up, folding in the ends when you reach the halfway mark."
