1,"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)."
2,"In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the milk, eggs, and cream, stirring until you have a smooth batter. Meanwhile, melt margarine in a cast iron skillet. Pour the batter over the melted margarine."
3,"Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. The pancake will puff up and create a bubble in the center. Take it out of the oven and allow it to cool until the pancake firms up or sinks. Cut into pieces, serve with maple syrup, and enjoy!"
