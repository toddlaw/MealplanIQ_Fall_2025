1,"Combine sugar, butter, evaporated milk, cream of tartar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix thoroughly and bring to a boil. Cook until it reaches the soft ball stage at 234 degrees F (115 degrees C), where a few drops form a soft ball when placed in cold water. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Add vanilla and beat until smooth and stiff. Shape the mixture into small potato-shaped balls. Roll each ball in cinnamon, then press in chopped nuts for eyes. For added effect, dust with cocoa to resemble dirt."
