1,"Carefully place the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat, cover it, and let the eggs sit for 12 minutes. Drain the hot water and immediately run cold water over the eggs to stop the cooking process. Peel the eggs once cool enough to handle."
2,"Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the yolks from each half and transfer them to a medium bowl. Set the empty egg whites aside on a plate."
3,"Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the yolks until smooth. Add the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and apple cider vinegar to the mashed yolks. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."
4,"**Optional:** If using any of the additional ingredients, fold them into the yolk mixture at this point."
5,"Using a spoon or piping bag, fill the empty egg white halves with the yolk mixture. You can mound the filling slightly for a decorative look."
6,"Garnish the deviled eggs with a sprinkle of paprika (optional) and serve immediately. Deviled eggs can also be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."
