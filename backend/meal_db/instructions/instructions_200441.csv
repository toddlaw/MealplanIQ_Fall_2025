1,"Marinate the Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the thinly sliced chicken with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine (or sherry) if using. Let the chicken marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes for extra tenderness."
2,"Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, chicken broth, oyster sauce (if using), sugar, rice vinegar, and a pinch of white pepper. Set aside."
3,"Heat the Wok: Heat 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot."
4,"Sear the Chicken: Add the marinated chicken to the hot wok and spread it out in a single layer. Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (depending on the thickness of the chicken pieces). Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside on a plate."
5,"Stir-fry the Vegetables: Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the sliced mushrooms, water chestnuts, snow peas, and bamboo shoots. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly softened and crisp-tender."
6,"Add the Aromatics: Add the minced garlic and ginger to the wok and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
7,"Pour in the Sauce: Add the prepared sauce mixture to the wok with the vegetables and bring to a simmer over medium heat."
8,"Thicken the Sauce (Optional): If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk together an additional 1 teaspoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency."
9,"Return the Chicken: Add the cooked chicken back to the wok with the simmering sauce and vegetables."
10,"Toss and Combine: Toss everything together gently to combine and coat the chicken and vegetables in the sauce."
11,"Heat Through: Simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the ingredients."
12,"Serve: Turn off the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil for extra flavor. Garnish with chopped green onions (scallions) and serve immediately with steamed rice. Enjoy your delicious Moo Goo Gai Pan!"
