1,"Preheat your oven to 450Â°F if using a conventional oven, or according to your pizza oven's instructions."
2,"If using store-bought dough, let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. If making your own dough, follow the recipe's instructions for proofing and preheating."
3,"On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch the pizza dough into a 12-inch round. You can use your hands or a rolling pin."
4,"Transfer the stretched dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal."

7,"Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese."
8,"Distribute the grated Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella cheese."
9,"Optional: Sprinkle a pinch of red pepper flakes for a touch of heat (adjust to your preference)."
10,"Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly."
11,"Keep an eye on your pizza as it bakes, as ovens can vary."
12,"Once the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack for a few minutes before slicing."
13,"Optional: Garnish the pizza with fresh arugula for a peppery and refreshing touch."
14,"Season the pizza with salt and pepper to taste."
