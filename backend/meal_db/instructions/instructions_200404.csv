A,"Make the Dough:"
1,"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt."
2,"Create a well in the center of the flour and add the eggs and olive oil."
3,"Using a fork, gently beat the eggs and oil together, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides until a shaggy dough forms."
4,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Add more flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky."
5,"Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes."
B,"Make the Filling:"
1,"In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside."
C,"Assemble the Ravioli:"
1,"Lightly flour a work surface. Divide the dough into two halves."
2,"Cover one half of the dough with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Roll the other half out into a thin sheet, about 1/16 inch thick. Use a dusting of semolina flour to prevent sticking if needed."
3,"Spoon dollops of the filling onto the dough sheet, leaving about 1-inch space between each dollop."
4,"Brush the edges of the dough around the filling with water."
5,"Carefully fold the dough sheet over the filling, matching the edges and pressing down to seal. Use a ravioli cutter or a fork to crimp the edges and cut out individual ravioli."
6,"Repeat steps 2-5 with the remaining dough and filling."
7,"Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust it with semolina flour. Arrange the uncooked ravioli on the baking sheet in a single layer."
8,"Cover the ravioli with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight."
D,"Cook the Ravioli:"
1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat."
2,"Carefully drop the ravioli into the boiling water, a few at a time. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface."
3,"Use a slotted spoon to remove the ravioli from the water and drain them well."
4,"Serve immediately with your favorite sauce, melted butter, and fresh sage leaves (optional)."
