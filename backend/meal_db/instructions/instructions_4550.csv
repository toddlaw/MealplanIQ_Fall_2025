1,"In a large bowl, sift flour and salt together. Add oil and combine with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly. Gradually mix in water until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic for about 8 minutes. Cover and let it rest for 45 minutes."
2,"Preheat a griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each rolled dough round on the griddle until bubbles and blisters form, roughly 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the other side is lightly browned."
3,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish."
