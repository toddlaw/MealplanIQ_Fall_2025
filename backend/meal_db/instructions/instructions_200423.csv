7,"Add the Spices and Stock: Add the ground spices, mushroom bouillon powder, and enough water or chicken broth to fill the pot to your desired level (consider the amount of ingredients you'll be cooking)."
8,"Bring to a Simmer: Bring the soup base to a simmer and let it simmer for at least 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to develop. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed (add more soy sauce for saltiness, chili crisp for extra spice)."
Part B,"Prepare the Hot Pot Ingredients"
9,"Prepare your chosen hot pot ingredients: Wash and slice the vegetables, meats, and seafood. Cube the tofu and soak the dried rice noodles according to package instructions."
Part C,"Assemble the Hot Pot"
