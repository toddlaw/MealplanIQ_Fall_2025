A,"Prepare Béchamel Sauce (Optional):"
1,"In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Don't let it brown."
2,"Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. This roux will thicken the sauce."
3,"Slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.** Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until thickened, whisking constantly. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using) to taste."
B,"Assemble the Croque-Monsieur"
4,"Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.** Alternatively, you can use a panini press."
5,"Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard on one side of each bread slice (optional).** You can spread it on both sides if you prefer a stronger mustard flavor."
6,"Spread a generous layer of béchamel sauce on the un-mustarded side of two bread slices.** Make sure to spread it all the way to the edges."
7,"Top each slice of bread with béchamel with a layer of sliced ham. Divide the ham slices evenly between the two sandwiches."
8,"Sprinkle the ham with shredded Gruyère cheese (or Swiss cheese)."
9,"Top each sandwich with another slice of bread, un-mustarded side facing up. This will be the outside of the sandwich that gets toasted."
10,"Spread a thin layer of softened butter on the outside of each bread slice."
11,"Carefully place the sandwiches on the preheated griddle or skillet. If using a panini press, follow the manufacturer's instructions."
12,"Cook the sandwiches for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy* Press down gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking."
13,"Optional Step (For Extra Melty Cheese): During the last minute of cooking, you can briefly place the pan under the broiler (watch closely to avoid burning) to achieve extra melty cheese on top."
14,"Cut the sandwiches in half diagonally and serve hot.** Enjoy the Croque-Monsieur as a delicious and satisfying lunch or light dinner!"
