1,"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix together the butter and milk until melted. Stir occasionally. Allow the mixture to cool."
2,"Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl. Add the cooled mixture of butter and milk to the dry ingredients and mix well by hand. Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Roll the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls and place them on the greased cookie sheets. The cookies will not spread much, so they can be placed relatively close together."
3,"Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until firm. Remove from baking sheets and let them cool on wire racks. When they have cooled, glaze the cookies with a thin confectioners' icing to help keep them fresh."
