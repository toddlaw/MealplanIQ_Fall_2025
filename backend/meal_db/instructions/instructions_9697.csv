1,"Place a silicone baking mat on a baking sheet."
2,"In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gently fold the flour mixture into the whipped egg whites until just combined."
3,"Gently fold in the vanilla extract and the food coloring until just combined."
4,"Squeeze the batter from the bag to pipe 1 1/2-inch rounds onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart."
5,"When the batter is mixed sufficiently to flatten into an even disk right away, transfer it into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in round shapes, ensuring there is space between each disk. Allow the piped cookies to sit at room temperature until a hard skin forms on top, approximately 1 hour."
6,"Prepare the oven by preheating it to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C)."
7,"Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until they are set but not browned, for approximately 10 minutes."
8,"Allow the cookies to cool fully before filling, which takes about 30 minutes."
