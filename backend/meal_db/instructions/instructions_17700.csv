1,"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans. Combine the cake flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl, whisking together."
2,"Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time. Gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with coconut milk. Mix in almond and vanilla extracts. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans."
3,"Bake the cakes in the preheated oven until lightly browned, for about 20 to 25 minutes. Check by inserting a wooden toothpick into the center of each cake to ensure it comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely."
