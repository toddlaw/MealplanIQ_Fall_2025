1,"In a separate bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs."
2,"In a medium saucepan, mix together 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until it reaches the thread stage, which is 230 degrees F (108 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, or until a small amount dropped in cold water forms a soft thread. Stir in the peel, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for 5 minutes while stirring frequently. Drain afterwards."
