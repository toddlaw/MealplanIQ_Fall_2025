Step,Instruction
A,"For the Biscuits"
1,"Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)."
2,"In a large bowl, whisk together the self-rising flour and salt."
3,"Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, cut the cold butter cubes into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining."
4,"Gradually stir in the cold buttermilk with a fork until a shaggy dough forms. Be careful not to overmix."
5,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times until just combined. Do not overwork the dough."
6,"Pat or roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1 inch."
7,"Use a biscuit cutter (or a cup) to cut out 2-inch rounds of dough."
8,"Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between them for rising."
9,"Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
B,"For the Sausage Gravy"
10,"While the biscuits are baking, cook the ground sausage links in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through. Break up the sausage with a spoon as it cooks."
11,"Drain off any excess grease from the pan."
12,"Sprinkle the black pepper over the cooked sausage and stir to combine."
13,"Reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the sausage. Stir constantly for about 2 minutes to cook the flour and create a roux."
14,"Whisk in the milk slowly, a little at a time, until a smooth and thick gravy forms. Season with salt to taste."
15,"Continue cooking for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens slightly.
C,"To Serve"
16,"Once the biscuits are baked and the gravy is ready, spoon the hot gravy over the warm biscuits."
17,"Garnish with chopped fresh chives (optional) and serve immediately."
