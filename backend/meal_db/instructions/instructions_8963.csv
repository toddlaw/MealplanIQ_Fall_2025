1,"Heat a large pot of water with a touch of salt until it comes to a boil. Add the spaghetti to the boiling water, stirring occasionally, and cook until it is tender but still al dente, approximately 12 minutes. Drain, mix the spaghetti with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and set it aside."
2,"Put the diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until it is browned evenly, approximately 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels, keeping 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the skillet."
3,"Stir in 1 tablespoon of olive oil with the bacon fat in the skillet. Incorporate the chopped onion and sauté over medium heat until the onion becomes translucent. Then, add the minced garlic and cook until aromatic, approximately 1 minute. Pour in the wine and continue cooking for an additional minute."
4,"Reintroduce the cooked bacon to the skillet and add the cooked spaghetti. Toss to combine and heat through, adding additional olive oil if it appears dry or clumps together. Incorporate the beaten eggs and cook, stirring continuously with tongs or a large fork, until the eggs are just barely set. Immediately add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and toss once more. Season with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that both bacon and Parmesan are quite salty."
5,"Serve warm, topped with chopped parsley and with additional Parmesan cheese available at the table."
