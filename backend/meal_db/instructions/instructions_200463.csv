step,instruction
1,"Place the clams in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Add a generous amount of salt (about 1 tablespoon) and let them soak for 30 minutes. This will help the clams purge any sand or grit."
2,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts of water)."
3,"While the water heats up, heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant."
4,"Do not let the garlic brown. Reduce heat to low if necessary."
5,"Drain the clams and discard any unopened ones. Add the clams to the hot skillet with the olive oil and garlic."
6,"Pour in the white wine and increase the heat to medium-high. Bring the wine to a simmer and cover the pan with a lid."
7,"Cook the clams for 5-7 minutes, or until the clams open. Discard any clams that remain closed after this time."
8,"Reserve about ½ cup of the clam cooking liquid before transferring the clams to a bowl with a slotted spoon. This flavorful liquid will be used in the sauce."
9,"Reduce heat to low and keep the clam cooking liquid warm in the skillet."
10,"Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-12 minutes)."
11,"Reserve about ½ cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta completely."
12,"Once the pasta is cooked, add it directly to the skillet with the reserved clam cooking liquid. Toss the pasta with the sauce to coat it evenly."
13,"If the sauce seems too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water at a time, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach a desired consistency."
14,"Add the cooked clams back to the pan and toss them gently with the pasta and sauce."
15,"Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped fresh parsley."
16,"Serve the Spaghetti alle Vongole immediately in warmed bowls. Enjoy the fresh seafood flavors!"
