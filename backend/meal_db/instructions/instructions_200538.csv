1,"Carefully roast the poblano peppers. You can do this by broiling them in the oven under high heat for 5-7 minutes per side, turning occasionally, until the skin is blistered and blackened. Alternatively, roast them directly over a gas stovetop flame, turning with tongs, until charred on all sides."
2,"Once roasted, place the peppers in a paper bag and seal it shut. Let them steam for 10-15 minutes. This will loosen the skin."
3,"While the peppers steam, prepare the filling. In a bowl, combine Monterey Jack cheese and any additional filling options you prefer (Oaxaca cheese, queso fresco, or green chiles)."
4,"Carefully peel the skin off the roasted peppers. Wear gloves if handling hot peppers. Slit each pepper open carefully and remove the seeds and veins. Pat the peppers dry with paper towels."
5,"Stuff each pepper with the cheese mixture. You can use a spoon or your fingers to gently pack the filling."
6,"Set up three shallow bowls for breading: one with flour seasoned with salt and pepper, one with beaten eggs, and one with clean flour again."
7,"Dredge each stuffed pepper in the seasoned flour, then dip it in the beaten egg, and finally coat it completely in the clean flour again. This creates a double dredge for a crispier coating."
8,"Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat (around 350Â°F). You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of bread in the oil - if it sizzles and floats immediately, the oil is hot enough."
9,"Carefully fry the chiles rellenos for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy."
10,"While the peppers are frying, prepare the sauce (optional). In a saucepan, heat olive oil and saute chopped onion until softened. Add diced tomato, garlic, and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes."
11,"Drain the fried chiles rellenos on paper towels. Serve hot with your desired sauce (optional) and enjoy!"
