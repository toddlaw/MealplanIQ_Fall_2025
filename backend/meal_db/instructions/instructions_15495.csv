1,Mix 2 cups warm water and yeast with 1/3 cup sugar in a large bowl. Allow to sit for approximately 5 minutes until a creamy layer develops on top. Add 3 cups of flour to create a loose sponge.

3,"Knead the dough on a floured surface to develop gluten for about 5 minutes. Shape it into a compact round, place it in an oiled bowl, and turn it to coat. Cover with a cloth and let it rise in a warm area until doubled in volume, approximately 1 hour. Punch down the dough and knead it until smooth and elastic for about 5 minutes."
4,"Prepare baking sheets by greasing them or lining them with parchment paper. Mix together 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon of oil, and 1 teaspoon of water in a small bowl to make a glaze; refrigerate until ready to use."
5,"Cut the dough into 4 pieces and then cut each piece into 3 smaller pieces to create 3-strand braided loaves. Roll 12 dough pieces on a floured surface into ropes around the thickness of your thumb and approximately 12 inches long. Pinch together 3 ropes at the top and braid them, starting with the right strand moving to the left over the middle strand, then taking the left strand over the new middle strand. Continue braiding until the loaf is complete. Fold and pinch the ends underneath for a tidy appearance. Repeat the braiding with the remaining dough ropes. Place the 4 loaves on the prepared baking sheets and allow them to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Brush the tops of the loaves with the egg glaze; set aside the extra glaze for later."
6,Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).
7,"Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then brush with additional glaze, and bake until the tops are shiny and golden brown, for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Allow the loaves to cool before slicing."
