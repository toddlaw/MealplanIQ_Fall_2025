step,instructions
Part A,"For the Pasta Dough"
1,"In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and semolina flour. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients."
2,"Add the eggs, olive oil, and salt to the well. Using a fork, gently beat the wet ingredients together, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides until a shaggy dough forms."
3,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour as needed to prevent sticking."
4,"Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to roll out."
Part B,"For the Ricotta Cheese Filling"
1,"In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg yolk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until well combined and season to taste. Set aside."
Part C,"For the Spinach and Ricotta Cheese Filling"
1,"Rinse the fresh spinach thoroughly and remove any tough stems."
2,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes.  Squeeze out any excess moisture from the cooked spinach."
3,"In a medium bowl, combine the cooked spinach, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg yolk, salt, and pepper. Mix well until well combined and season to taste. Set aside."
Part D,"Assembling the Ravioli"
1,"Lightly flour a work surface. Divide the dough into two halves. Cover one half with plastic wrap to prevent drying while you work on the other half."
2,"Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on the floured surface to a thin sheet, about 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick. Dust the dough with additional flour as needed to prevent sticking."
3,"Optional: If using a ravioli mold, lightly flour the mold. Place a spoonful of filling onto one side of each ravioli mold indentation. Brush the edges of the dough with water to help seal. Fold the other side of the dough over the filling and press down firmly to seal the edges using the mold. Cut out the ravioli shapes with the mold."
4,"If not using a mold: Place spoonfuls of filling about 1-inch apart onto one half of the rolled-out dough sheet. Brush the dough around the filling with water. Fold the other half of the dough sheet over the filling and press down firmly to seal the edges, pushing out any air pockets. Use a knife to cut out ravioli squares or desired shapes."
5,"Repeat steps 2-4 with the remaining dough and filling."
6,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add a drizzle of olive oil to the water (optional, to prevent sticking)."
7,"Carefully drop the ravioli, a few at a time, into the boiling water. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface."
