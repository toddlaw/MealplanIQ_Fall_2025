1,"Whisk together flour, eggs, olive oil, salt, and water in a medium bowl until smooth. Heat a 7-inch skillet over medium-high heat and lightly brush with olive oil. Pour enough batter into the pan to cover the bottom. Cook until the top sets and the bottom browns, around 30 seconds. Transfer the pancake to parchment paper. Repeat the process. Fill with meat or cheese, top with tomato sauce, and bake."
