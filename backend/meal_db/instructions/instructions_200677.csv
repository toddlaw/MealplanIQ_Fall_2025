1,"Cutting the Tortillas: There are two options for cutting the tortillas:"
1a,"Triangles: Cut the tortillas into wedges or triangles, similar to how you would cut a pie."
1b,"Squares: Stack a few tortillas and cut them into strips, then again into squares or rectangles."
2,"Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat (350Â°F). You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of tortilla into the hot oil. If it sizzles and floats immediately, the oil is hot enough."
3,"Fry the tortilla strips or triangles in batches for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.** Drain the fried tortillas on paper towels to remove excess oil."
4,"In a separate saucepan or pot, heat the salsa roja or salsa verde (see separate recipe) over medium heat.** You can add a splash of water to thin the salsa slightly, if desired."
5,"Once the salsa is simmering, add the fried tortilla chips and toss them gently to coat them evenly with the salsa.** Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the tortillas are softened slightly and heated through."
6,"Optional Step:** If you prefer softer chilaquiles, simmer for a few minutes longer, but be careful not to overcook them or they will become mushy."
7,"Assemble the Chilaquiles:** Transfer the salsa-coated tortilla chips to a serving plate."
8,"Top with Queso Fresco cheese (or Cotija cheese), diced red onion, chopped cilantro, and diced avocado (optional)."
9,"Serve Chilaquiles immediately while hot. Squeeze fresh lime wedges over your plate for added acidity (optional)."
10,"Optional Garnishes: You can add dollops of crema Mexicana, fried eggs, cooked black beans, or shredded chicken for additional protein and flavor."
