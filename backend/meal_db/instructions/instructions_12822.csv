1,"Mix together flour, egg yolks, sour cream, sugar, softened butter, rum, and salt in a large bowl until a dough forms."
2,"Knead the dough gently, then roll it out on a floured surface. Cut the dough into 4-inch long and 3/4-inch wide strips. Make a slit in the middle of each strip, then twist and pull one end through the slit."
3,Fry a few pastry twists at a time in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels before serving.
