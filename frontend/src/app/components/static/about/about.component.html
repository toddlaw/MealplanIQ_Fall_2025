        <h1 class="text-center">About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to fight disease and improve health through personalized meal plans, generated by AI from an extensive recipe database, guided by a healthcare professional, meeting government dietary recommendations and accessible through an easy-to-use on-line interface. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-center">Our Philosphy</h1>
        <p>
          We believe deciding that what to cook and eat is a highly personal decision, and dependant on many factors including age, weight, 
          activity levels, religion, allergies, cuisine preferences, cooking skills, and health goals. <br>
          We believe that food can fight cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and other conditions. <br>
          We believe in proven science technology, not gimmicks or shortcuts.  We believe AI can be used to generate personalized meal plans which meet many constraints. <br>
          We believe that creating meal plans should be as easy booking a plane ticket or a hotel room! <br>
          We believe in government guidelines (such the United States’ USDA dietary recommendations) and the expertise of registered dietitians as a baseline for meal plans.<br>
